//! The slab's per-slot ballot sequence: the reconfiguration law's pin.
//!
//! The slab assert `docs/uvr-fuse.md` §3 puts on the acceptor before it
//! folds a slab is `tail_ballot >= head_ballot && head_ballot >=
//! current_promise`, strict exactly when the slab spans an era boundary,
//! where `tail_ballot` is the ballot of the slab's final packed slot,
//! `first_slot + count - 1` (§1). Under the per-slot era law (the era
//! advances once per establishing slot, the nomination riding with it) a
//! crossing slab's tail ballot strictly exceeds its head ballot: this test
//! drives one legal fused slab through the public path and reads the ballot
//! the library itself installed at each packed slot, so the law is an
//! observation of the wire, not an assumption.
//!
//! This is the pin that the one-era reading is gone: under it the packed
//! slots of one establishing batch carried ONE ballot, `head_ballot ==
//! tail_ballot`, and the strict advance was absent — the #136 Andon this
//! file was born to reproduce.
