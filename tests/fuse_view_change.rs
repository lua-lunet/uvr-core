//! The fuse / view-change resolution (docs/uvrr-fuse.md §4 step 6; spec
//! §9.1, §9.2 and the §1.3 ranking rule): a fused batch accepted by a
//! quorum under view v, the leader crashed before the commit emission,
//! and the next view's recovery of what the quorum knew.
//!
//! The invariants these tests run under. The host obligations are held by
//! construction: the harness never recycles an identity (a crashed node
//! re-enters only through the boot gate's reincarnation path, which these
//! scripts never invoke) and every emission the scripts deliver was
//! durable before it was emitted (the publish path journals the
//! transition before it releases the effects). The test space is
//! therefore exhaustive over the protocol behaviour the scripts gate:
//! acceptance, fencing, evidence ranking and installation, with no
//! host-law violation able to masquerade as a protocol outcome.
//!
//! The ranking rule under test (§1.3; the Lean `ViewSelection.RankLE`
//! rule): the selected history is the greatest by retained view first,
//! then accepted frontier. Ranking by length alone is the published §9.2
//! counterexample, and `selection_is_view_first_not_length_first` is its
//! Rust witness: an older-view report with a longer log loses to a
//! newer-view report whose shorter log carries the fused values, the
//! mirror of Lean's `ViewSelection.newer_view_wins` and
//! `ViewSelection.length_only_loses_committed`.
