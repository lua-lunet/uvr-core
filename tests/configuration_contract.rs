//! Contract for [`uvrr::configuration`], era, membership, voting weights, and the
//! reconfiguration operation alphabet.
//!
//! Spec §8.7.1 (configuration and era), §8.7.2 (the operation alphabet and its
//! precondition table), §8.7.5 (closure of weighted-majority configurations), §8.4
//! (weighted quorums, weight 0 = learner), §1.2 (primary selection), and decisions Q1
//! (quorum families are validated, not counted), W1 (era is its own field), W3/W4 (the
//! binary codec is normative and fixed-width).
//!
//! This file gates the *fold*, not quorum policy. Nothing here evaluates a quorum: that
//! is the [`uvrr::quorum::QuorumStrategy`] and its closed gate in [`uvrr::quorum`]. What is gated here
//! is the set of configurations that can exist at all, because every later intersection
//! argument (§8.7.4 `R1`/`R2`) is stated over configurations reachable by this fold and
//! is meaningless over configurations that are not.
//!
//! Six properties, each of which the rest of the crate is entitled to assume:
//!
//! 1. **A [`uvrr::configuration::Configuration`] cannot be constructed invalid.** The only ways in are
//!    [`uvrr::configuration::Configuration::void()`] and `apply`, so "non-empty `order` after [`uvrr::configuration::SystemOperation::Init`], no
//!    duplicate [`uvrr::ids::NodeId`], representable total" holds for every value that exists rather
//!    than for every value someone remembered to validate.
//! 2. **Era is established, not assigned.** [`uvrr::configuration::SystemOperation::Void`] establishes era 0, [`uvrr::configuration::SystemOperation::Init`] era 1, and
//!    every subsequent accepted operation `era + 1`. §8.7.8's rule that a replica may
//!    propose era `e` only if it holds the operation establishing `e` is then checkable
//!    by construction.
//! 3. **Refusal is specific.** Every precondition of §8.7.2's table has its own
//!    [`uvrr::configuration::ConfigError`] variant and every test below asserts *that* variant. A test that
//!    accepts `is_err()` passes when the implementation refuses for the wrong reason,
//!    which is precisely the failure mode a precondition table exists to prevent.
//! 4. **Nothing saturates and nothing rounds.** [`uvrr::configuration::SystemOperation::Halve`] on an odd weight is refused,
//!    not floored; [`uvrr::configuration::SystemOperation::Increment`] and [`uvrr::configuration::SystemOperation::Double`] past [`uvrr::configuration::MAX_WEIGHT`]
//!    are refused, not clamped; [`uvrr::configuration::SystemOperation::Decrement`] at weight 0 is refused, not a no-op.
//!    §8.7.5's closure proofs are arithmetic identities over exact weights and a
//!    rounded weight makes them vacuous. The domain is {0, 1, 2} (rules §1, R1), and
//!    every weight below asserts the boundary at both ends.
//! 5. **The fold is persistent.** `apply` and [`uvrr::configuration::EraTable::extend`] return new values and
//!    share retained `Arc`s. `Arc` identity is asserted by pointer comparison, because
//!    a table that deep-copied its history would still pass every behavioural test
//!    while making configuration history a per-message allocation.
//! 6. **The retention window is bounded and its overflow is a drop.** Three eras
//!    resident; an era outside the window is absent from the table, which is what makes
//!    an out-of-window message undecidable and therefore droppable (§10, §14.2).
//!
//! Groups 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11 and 12 are exhaustive loops rather than samplers: the
//! domains are small and total coverage is strictly stronger than any number of draws.
//! Group 8 in particular walks *every* operation sequence up to length 4 over a fixed
//! alphabet, which is a Definition-of-Done requirement for the era state machine.
