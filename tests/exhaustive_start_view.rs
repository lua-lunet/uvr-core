//! Exhaustive per-message properties: the [`uvrr::wire::Tag::StartView`] a node adopts (§9.1,
//! §13.1).
//!
//! One message over the cross product of the dimensions the handler branches
//! on: the installed view against the node's current view, and the offered
//! history against the node's durable frontiers. Exhaustive by construction
//! under the host obligations: the identity law (never recycled, so a slot
//! is assigned once and a shared committed slot has one honest entry, which
//! makes a conflicting offer the declared safety breach), the boot-gate
//! marker states (the receiver was never halted, so its checkpoint frontier
//! is the `Slot(0)` sentinel), and the quorum gate (Q1). An honest evidence
//! quorum can never produce the conflict offer; the case pins the fault.
