//! Exhaustive per-message properties: the rejoin gossip request a node hears
//! (`docs/uvrr-protocols.md`, the rejoin chapter §2 to §3).
//!
//! One message over the cross product of the dimensions the handler branches
//! on: the receiver's role (the leader answers, every other node only
//! records), the sender's membership (a cluster member is pushed but never
//! listed; a node outside the cluster uses the request as its join), and the
//! sender's prepared frontier against the receiver's committed frontier (the
//! push's extent). Exhaustive by construction under the host obligations:
//! the identity law (universally unique and never recycled, so the minted
//! foreign sender is outside the configuration for the life of the test and
//! the witness list names it exactly once), the boot-gate marker states (the
//! receiver was never halted, so it holds its assembled [`uvrr::progress::Status::Normal`] life), and
//! the quorum gate fixed at construction (Q1). Every node that hears the
//! request records the sender, whatever its own transition's outcome, and
//! the list never names a voter. The request's frontiers ride the body; the
//! header slot is the `Slot(0)` sentinel (the per-tag table's Absent role).
