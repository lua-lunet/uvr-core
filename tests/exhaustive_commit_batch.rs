//! Exhaustive per-message properties: the [`uvrr::wire::Tag::CommitBatch`] a backup receives
//! (`docs/uvrr-fuse.md` §4).
//!
//! One message, applied to a node in an assembled state, over the plain cross
//! product of the dimensions the receive path branches on: the receiver's role
//! and the batch's view against the receiver's current view. The space is
//! exhaustive by construction under these host obligations: the identity law
//! (a lawful pair is universally unique and never recycled, so the fabricated
//! batch's frontiers name slots no lawful history could confuse); the
//! boot-gate marker states (the receiver was never halted, so it holds its
//! assembled [`uvrr::progress::Status::Normal`] life); and the quorum gate fixed at construction (Q1).
//! The backups already learn commitment through the ordinary commit
//! announcement, so the batch is the leader's per-era emission, received by
//! name and dropped at every node, every state.
