//! Exhaustive per-message properties: the [`uvrr::wire::Tag::StartViewChange`] fence a node
//! votes with (§9.1).
//!
//! One message over the cross product of the dimensions the handler branches
//! on: whether the node already runs an in-progress attempt, the fenced view
//! against the node's fence target (or current view, without one), and the
//! sender's membership. Exhaustive by construction under the host
//! obligations: the identity law (universally unique and never recycled, so
//! a minted foreign sender is outside the configuration for the life of the
//! test), the boot-gate marker states (the receiver was never halted, so it
//! holds its assembled [`uvrr::progress::Status::Normal`] life), and the quorum gate fixed at
//! construction (Q1), which makes the fence and evidence quorums the
//! strategy's own decisions. The attempt state is volatile by design (§9.3),
//! so the assembled attempt is the whole of what a fence vote can meet.
