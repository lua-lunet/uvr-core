//! Reincarnation: the Crash-Stop-Self-Evict corpus
//! (`docs/uvr-protocols.md`, the reincarnation chapter).
//!
//! The classes:
//!
//! * **A**, the Voting Weights worked examples (the halve/double and
//!   ±1-unit rules the forced sequence is grounded in) as ordinary
//!   reconfigurations, at the configuration-fold level and through the
//!   live replica path.
//! * **B**, a backup crashed dirty: restart-as-new-identity, the
//!   `Reincarnation` announcement, the leader's forced sequence, every
//!   intermediate era quorum-safe, final membership correct (rejoin).
//! * **D**, the marker transition machine (`docs/uvr-io-obligations.md`, the boot-gate chapter §2): the EXHAUSTIVE closed
//!   4-copy domain (4⁴ = 256 assignments), 2-of-4 [`uvrr::lifecycle::Marker::Stopped`] ⟺ the clean
//!   stop, every other assignment bumps, the identity resolved INSIDE the
//!   working quorum (higher-identity-wins, never across all copies),
//!   all-[`uvrr::progress::Status::Joining`] reincarnates again; plus the stop path
//!   (`begin_stop`/`finish_stop`, the marker order as the drain's proof)
//!   and continuation commitment.
//! * **E**, membership discard: messages from an unknown or superseded
//!   identity ignored by the leader.
//! * **F**, the reincarnated weight-0 standby: the memo stream keeps it
//!   current without a fetch; the §10 self-fetch route pinned separately;
//!   never votes, cannot influence.
//! * **G**, mutation negative controls: mutated variants are rejected.
//!
//! The old amnesia-era corpus (the classic [VR-2012] §4.3 recovery tests,
//! `docs/references.md`) was
//! deleted with the classic recovery path; this corpus is its
//! replacement, the same restart/freshness surface, now the
//! Crash-Stop-Self-Evict protocol, which has no recovery protocol to test.
