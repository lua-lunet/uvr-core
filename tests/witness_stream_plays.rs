//! Witness stream plays: the two exact walk-throughs of
//! `docs/uvrr-protocols.md`, the reincarnation chapter §7–§8 as message choreography.
//!
//! * **Play A (three nodes)**, n1 isolated, n3 crashes and reincarnates
//!   as a witness; the leader streams phase-2 but cannot commit; the
//!   network heals, the isolated node gap-detects and fetches, its
//!   cumulative ack completes every outstanding slot, the leader commits
//!   in slot order, and the streamed join batches carry the witness to
//!   full membership, it leaves the leader's witness list.
//! * **Play B (five nodes)**, an isolated leader in a minority keeps its
//!   witness current on uncommitted slots; the leader crashes, the
//!   majority elects a new leader; the witness re-announces on its own
//!   timer, the new leader's stream OVERRIDES the dead view's uncommitted
//!   slots, and the recomputed join commits at the new leader's slots.
