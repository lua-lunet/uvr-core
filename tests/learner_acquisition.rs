//! Learner acquisition (the reincarnation chapter §10): a joined weight-0 member folds the era that
//! admitted it through its own fetch, stays fenced while its weight is 0,
//! and, only after a committed `INCREMENT` grants it weight,
//! participates in the era's quorum arithmetic.
//!
//! The gap this corpus pins: the establishing operation's fan-out reaches
//! configuration members only, the serving gate judged the sender against
//! the requested era's configuration, and the boot fence never moved the
//! committed frontier, so a fresh join could never fold its admitting era
//! and no fresh join converged. The learner acquisition rule
//! (`docs/uvrr-protocols.md`, the reincarnation chapter §10) closes it with the ordinary state
//! transfer: the leader serves a member of its current committed
//! configuration, and the boot-fenced node's own fetch is its qualified
//! evidence.
//!
//! The retention rule's full admission vocabulary: a far-future offer is
//! retained only when it NAMES the boot-fenced member, through the [`uvrr::configuration::SystemOperation::Join`]
//! that inserts it, the [`uvrr::configuration::SystemOperation::Increment`] that promotes it, or a batch carrying
//! either, and an offer naming nobody (a departure, a scaling op) is
//! dropped `UnevaluableEra` with the boot fence untouched. The
//! acquisition's era-window walk re-issues its fetch under the WALKED
//! view, so the retention window, three eras spanned and two resident,
//! cannot evict the record the next
//! chunk needs.
