//! Manifest contract: the published dependency surface of `uvrr-core`.
//!
//! This is a gate, not a smoke test. It asserts properties of `Cargo.toml` and
//! `src/lib.rs` that a later change cannot silently regress by adding a convenient
//! dependency or relaxing a lint. It reads both files with `include_str!` and
//! parses with std string operations only, deliberately: pulling in a TOML crate
//! to police the dependency set would be self-defeating, and a `[dev-dependencies]`
//! entry is still a build-time dependency for anyone who runs `cargo test` on this
//! crate. The parser below is therefore crude on purpose. It only needs to be
//! correct for a manifest this crate controls.
//!
//! Desired property, stated once so it survives any rewrite of the assertions: a
//! consumer who writes `uvrr-core = "0.1"` with `default-features = false` pulls in
//! zero transitive crates, so that `uvrr-core` can be vendored into a build with a
//! frozen or audited dependency set (decision W2, W3).
