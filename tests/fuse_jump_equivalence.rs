//! The fused jump and the per-slot step-through land in the same state:
//! the equivalence proof of the per-slot view-jump law
//! (`docs/uvr-protocols.md`, the NOMINATE chapter).
//!
//! The Repetitive Construct, made mechanical: the same solver schedule is
//! driven through one cluster twice. The stepped run proposes one
//! establishing batch per transition through the ordinary pipeline, so
//! every published transition advances the serving view by at most one
//! establishing slot's worth — the rule honoured step by step, observed
//! on the library's own numbers. The fused run submits the same steps as
//! the leader's armed plan, whose batches travel as
//! [`uvrr::wire::Tag::Fuse`] envelopes; the cluster commits the same
//! slots and the nomination riders walk the serving view. If both runs
//! end in the same final state — the same journal whole, the same
//! committed configuration, the same serving view — then the fused jump
//! is exactly the telescoped sum of the steps the stepped run proved
//! legal, and the law's arithmetic holds: the total jump divided by the
//! packed slot count is in `(0, 1]`, one era per establishing slot.
//!
//! The scenario is the expansion of a three-member cluster to five at a
//! fixed serving view, the leader constant throughout (`tests/nominate_leader_assignment.rs`
//! is the same schedule's step-by-step ladder). Nothing here reads a
//! synthetic state pair: every number is a snapshot, a journal entry or
//! an era-table record the library itself installed.
