//! The cold-start corpus: the staggered genesis start, the post-genesis
//! cold restart through the marker machine, and the crash-shape Joining
//! pin.
//!
//! All shapes are deterministic and clockless: ticks only, no sleeps, no
//! RNG, the harness is the host (`tests/harness/mod.rs`). The knobs every
//! script runs: `primary_timeout = 3` host ticks, `view_change_budget`
//! unbounded, the same view-change knob values the other knob-driven
//! corpora use.
//!
//! # The staggered-provisioning expression
//!
//! The harness provisions a deployment at construction and offers no
//! provision-later entry point, so a node whose process starts later is
//! expressed as: crash it at epoch 0, before it ever ran, and `reopen`
//! it over the recorded disk when it starts. The disk of a node crashed at
//! epoch 0 is exactly [`uvrr::replica::Replica::provision`]'s state (the pristine genesis), so the
//! reopened node and a freshly provisioned one are state-identical, and
//! the bootstrap rules treat them alike. Datagrams sent while the node is
//! down sit in the harness's queue and are delivered once it is back: the
//! script decides delivery, as in every corpus.
//!
//! # The shapes
//!
//! 1. **Staggered genesis start**: two weight-1 nodes, [`uvrr::quorum::WeightedMajority`].
//!    n(0) alone through several `primary_timeout` windows, the machinery
//!    fires exactly one fence (a solo node's first firing moves it to
//!    [`uvrr::progress::Status::ViewChange`], and a [`uvrr::progress::Status::ViewChange`] node has nothing to suspect), the
//!    fence into the succession view whose primary is the absent n(1),
//!    then n(1) starts; both tick in lockstep rounds. The pin: a leader is
//!    elected, a first value commits, both apply.
//! 2. **Post-genesis cold restart through the marker machine**
//!    (`docs/uvrr-io-obligations.md`, the boot-gate chapter §2): committed normal
//!    operations past the genesis plus one committed reconfiguration era,
//!    then the HOST performs the controlled stop of each node,
//!    `begin_stop`, the drain, `finish_stop`, and the boot's quorum read
//!    ([`uvrr::lifecycle::SuperblockCopies::restart`]) answers the one question it asks: the
//!    2-of-4 [`uvrr::lifecycle::Marker::Stopped`] verdict is the clean stop, the identity continues,
//!    and the node boots as [`uvrr::progress::Status::Restarting`], a member with complete state
//!    and no amnesia. Staggered: n(0) restarts and ticks ALONE through
//!    several timeout windows, it ticks the FULL protocol, so it now
//!    suspects the silent primary and issues [`uvrr::wire::Tag::StartViewChange`]; no quorum
//!    evidence can arrive until n(1) restarts, then n(1) restarts, the
//!    mutually-heard fence completes, and the ordinary
//!    fence/evidence/install pipeline finishes the restart: a leader is
//!    elected at/beyond the folded era, a NEW value commits, both apply.
//!    There is NO `AdminForceView` anywhere: the tick does the work, the
//!    old cold-start "wedge" was a test's misunderstanding of uVRR, and
//!    under the marker machine it does not exist.
//! 3. **The crash-shape Joining pin**: a node restarted through the
//!    machine with a NON-stopped marker set, the markers its boot wrote,
//!    the crash shape, bumps and enters [`uvrr::progress::Status::Joining`]. It is not a member: it
//!    neither votes nor view-changes (its tick drives only its own
//!    re-drive, and its solo windows emit not one datagram), and anything
//!    it emits is dropped by the §6 membership checks, a fabricated
//!    fence vote from the bumped identity is discarded by name and
//!    disturbs nothing.

/// A running node's markers hold the [`uvrr::progress::Status::Restarting`] 4x its boot wrote, so a
/// crash leaves exactly the no-controlled-shutdown evidence: no 2-of-4
/// [`uvrr::lifecycle::Marker::Stopped`]. The boot's quorum read ([`uvrr::lifecycle::SuperblockCopies::restart`]) bumps
/// the identity and writes [`uvrr::progress::Status::Joining`] 4x. The bumped node is NOT a member:
/// it neither votes nor view-changes, its tick drives only its own
/// re-drive, so its solo windows emit not one datagram, and anything it
/// emits is dropped by the §6 membership checks: a fabricated
/// [`uvrr::wire::Tag::StartViewChange`] from the bumped identity is discarded by name
/// (`UnknownSender`) and disturbs the live member not at all.
