//! Exhaustive per-message properties: the [`uvrr::wire::Tag::Fuse`] envelope an acceptor folds
//! (`docs/uvrr-fuse.md` §1, §3).
//!
//! One message over the cross product of the dimensions the handler branches
//! on: the envelope's view against the receiver's current view, the
//! envelope's first slot against the accept frontier's successor, and the
//! packed schedule's legality against the configuration fold. Exhaustive by
//! construction under the host obligations: the identity law (universally
//! unique and never recycled, so the minted identity the schedule names is
//! outside the configuration for the life of the test, which is what makes
//! the illegal schedule's fold refuse), the boot-gate marker states (the
//! receiver was never halted, so it holds its assembled [`uvrr::progress::Status::Normal`] life), and
//! the quorum gate fixed at construction (Q1). The envelope is atomic (§2):
//! the packed schedule folds whole or the whole envelope is refused, never a
//! partial fold and never a wire nack, so the one named outcome covers every
//! refusal.
