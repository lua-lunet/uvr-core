//! Rejoin gossip: the anti-wedge design as explicit message-level tests.
//!
//! The brief this corpus pins (`docs/uvrr-protocols.md`, the rejoin chapter):
//! a node outside the cluster gossips to find it, the join gossip carries
//! its frontiers, every node that hears it lists the sender as a
//! gossip-witness, and the leader, only the leader, streams all phase-2s
//! and commits to that list, push-first, until the joiner promotes (and is
//! then dropped from the list) or forever (a statically registered witness
//! is never purged). The [`uvrr::wire::Tag::GossipRequest`] is the gap half of the same
//! gossip: any node that cannot commit in order fires it at every node,
//! and only the node that believes itself leader answers with the missing
//! range and a fresh commit, a cluster member is pushed but never listed.
//!
//! Every assertion is on the wire or on the witness list itself, not on
//! end states alone: the messages the design names are the messages the
//! tests require.
