//! Exhaustive per-message properties: the [`uvrr::wire::Tag::FuseOk`] the serving primary counts
//! (`docs/uvrr-fuse.md` §2, §4 step 3).
//!
//! One message, applied to the primary in an assembled state, over the plain
//! cross product of the dimensions the handler branches on: the sender's
//! membership, the ack's view against the primary's current view, and the
//! ack's header slot against the outstanding proposal. The space is exhaustive
//! by construction under these host obligations: the identity law (a lawful
//! pair is universally unique and never recycled, so a minted foreign sender
//! is outside the configuration for the life of the test); the boot-gate
//! marker states (the primary was never halted, so it holds its assembled
//! [`uvrr::progress::Status::Normal`] life); and the quorum gate fixed at construction (Q1). One
//! [`uvrr::wire::Tag::FuseOk`] is ONE atomic vote vouching for the whole envelope (§2): the acks
//! body is the acceptor's wire evidence and is never examined for counting,
//! so the fabricated body carries the batch's slots and the counting runs on
//! the header's coverage alone.
