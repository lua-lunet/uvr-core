//! The boot gate: the lifecycle trait and the typestate driver
//! (`docs/uvrr-io-obligations.md`, the boot-gate chapter).
//!
//! The classes:
//!
//! * **A**, the identity×marker cohort matrix: the torn-copy domain
//!   with mixed identities, exhaustively enumerated over three
//!   identities and four markers (12⁴ = 20 736 assignments), every
//!   verdict checked against an independently recomputed oracle, the
//!   working cohort, higher-identity-wins inside it, [`uvrr::lifecycle::Marker::Stopped`] ⟺ the
//!   winner cohort holds ≥2 [`uvrr::lifecycle::Marker::Stopped`], and `QuorumLost` ⟺ no cohort
//!   reaches the open threshold.
//! * **B**, the fixed write schedules, asserted against the harness
//!   gate's operation log: the first life's anchor, the controlled
//!   halt's two rounds with the drain strictly between, the clean
//!   start's single latch round, and the dirty fast start's deferred
//!   latch.
//! * **C**, the deferral witness: the reincarnation's latch is
//!   unreachable until the engine's seated observation mints it; the
//!   markers hold the honest not-stopped evidence throughout the
//!   catch-up.
//! * **D**, the wedge guard: the kill-shape markers classify crashed,
//!   the same-identity resume refuses (error-on-crashed is the
//!   contract), and the only path onward is reincarnation.
//! * **E**, the re-crash replay: a crash between the pair's decision
//!   and the deferred latch re-reads the old markers and re-decides
//!   the same pair.
