//! The NOMINATE force-feed ladder (`docs/uvr-protocols.md`, the NOMINATE chapter):
//! the solver's plans driven through the ordinary pipeline, one establishing
//! [`uvrr::configuration::SystemOperation::Batch`] entry at one slot, never a [`uvrr::wire::Tag::Fuse`] envelope, with the script
//! feeding every released message to its addressee, and the leader asserted
//! at every committed slot of every scenario.
//!
//! The leader a node computes is the configuration its own committed
//! history has established, evaluated at its current view number: the
//! arithmetic that slot's commit switched to, asked for the node's view.
//! The constant-leader invariant: at every committed slot, every live
//! voter names the same node, the leader the plan started under. Without
//! the nominations the modulo rule moves the answer mid-plan (the Red
//! rung); the solver's emission and the commit-time bump keep it constant
//! (the Green rung). Where no rider landed, the era boundary the §8.7.8
//! gate guards is crossed by the leader-preserving forced change (§14.2),
//! the same view number the rider would have named.
