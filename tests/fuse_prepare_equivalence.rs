//! The equivalence claim (`docs/uvr-fuse.md` §8) under the per-slot era
//! law: a fused slab of N ops produces the same accepts, journal entries —
//! the same slot, the same era stamp, the same value at every packed slot —
//! and the same promise as the same N ops arriving as N individual
//! [`uvrr::wire::Tag::Prepare`]s at consecutive slots, only the datagram
//! count differing. The test drives one reconfiguration schedule twice over
//! identical clusters, once slot by slot as individual `Prepare`s with
//! nothing between them, once as a single [`uvrr::wire::Tag::Fuse`]
//! envelope, and asserts the acceptor's post-state is identical: the
//! promise (era AND view), the installed value and era stamp at every slot,
//! and both frontiers. Nothing is presumed about whether the batch is
//! stepped through or installed as a slab; the observation is the public
//! snapshot and journal alone.
//!
//! The schedule is the join-and-promote batch of `tests/fuse.rs`: the
//! promote is legal only against the configuration the join's own fold
//! established, which is exactly the chain fold the equivalence claim names
//! (§8: each payload's guards are evaluated against the in-memory
//! configuration the fold of the preceding payloads established).
//!
//! The law's two consequences for the net:
//!
//! * The era advances once per establishing slot, so the step-through's
//!   second `Prepare` is stamped with the era the first slot's commit
//!   established — and is admissible only then, the ordinary accept path's
//!   era authorization (§8.7.3, §8.7.8) refusing an entry whose era the
//!   committed history has not established. The commit of the head slot
//!   separates the two proposals, exactly the paced emission §6 states.
//! * Both paths commit as the paced fold admits: the riderless slab's tail
//!   defers past the era window (§4 step 4), so both paths end with the
//!   head era committed, the tail accepted, and the view unmoved.
//!
//! The rider's seat is out of scope by construction: a `Nominate` exists
//! only as a batch's last sub-operation, so no bare-entry step-through
//! carries one; the ridered slab's correspondence is the commit fold's
//! segmentation, pinned row by row in `tests/fuse.rs`.
