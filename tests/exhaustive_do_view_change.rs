//! Exhaustive per-message properties: the [`uvrr::wire::Tag::DoViewChange`] evidence the
//! designated new primary collects (§9.1, §8.7.7, §13.1).
//!
//! One message over the cross product of the dimensions the handler branches
//! on: the evidence kind, the sender's membership, the evidence's view
//! against the attempt target, and the reported accepted frontier against
//! the receiver's own. Exhaustive by construction under the host
//! obligations: the identity law (universally unique and never recycled, so
//! a minted foreign sender is outside the configuration for the life of the
//! test, and the fabricated entries' identities belong to exactly one slot
//! each), the boot-gate marker states (the receiver was never halted, so its
//! evidence and attempt are the assembled life's whole), and the quorum gate
//! (Q1), which makes the receiver and one reporter the evidence quorum. The
//! retained-provenance relation is not enumerated: every honest reporter of
//! the assembled era holds the same retained view, and a divergent
//! provenance is the ranking rule's, covered by view change.
