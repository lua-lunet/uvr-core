//! Exhaustive per-message properties: the `Reincarnation` announcement the
//! leader acts on (`docs/uvrr-protocols.md`, the reincarnation chapter §4, §7).
//!
//! One message over the cross product of the dimensions the handler branches
//! on: the receiver's role (only the leader drives the forced sequence), the
//! sender against the pair the announcement names (a forgery drops), the
//! announced pair's distinctness, and the past-life prepared frontier against
//! the leader's committed frontier (the immediate ack's extent). Exhaustive
//! by construction under the host obligations: the identity law (universally
//! unique, durable before emission and never recycled, so the minted old and
//! new identities name a pair no lawful life has held, and the mint check at
//! the flow's end verifies the halves never moved, reverted or read as zero),
//! the boot-gate marker states (the receiver was never halted, so it holds
//! its assembled [`uvrr::progress::Status::Normal`] life), and the quorum gate fixed at construction
//! (Q1). Every node that hears the announcement records the sender as a
//! gossip witness, whatever its own transition's outcome.
