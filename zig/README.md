# zig/ — vendored TigerBeetle 0.17.9 storage stack

This tree vendors TigerBeetle 0.17.9's actual storage stack and drives it
through a C-ABI static library; `examples/uvr-reincarnation/` is the consumer.

## Vendored (verbatim, from upstream `src/`)

- `io.zig`, `io/{linux,darwin,windows,common}.zig` — the direct-IO subsystem
- `queue.zig`, `time.zig`, `trace.zig`, `trace/*.zig`, `stdx/` (support closure)
- `testing/{time,exhaustigen}.zig` (imported by the above)
- `vsr/checksum.zig` (AEGIS-128L checksum), `vsr/superblock_quorums.zig`
  (3-of-4 write / 2-of-4 read quorum logic, verbatim)
- `toolchain/download.sh` — TB's pinned Zig 0.14.1 fetcher

## Patched (every changed line in PATCH_MANIFEST.md)

- `constants.zig` — reduced to the tiny data file (sector 4096 kept; block
  size 4 KiB for the checkpoint zone; no TB WAL ring buffers, no 512 KiB LSM
  grid, no client replies)
- `vsr/superblock.zig` — slimmed VSRState, `uvrr_incarnation` +
  `uvrr_marker` fields (the four-state reincarnation marker of
  `docs/uvr-durability-model.md` §5.1), checksum masked over the marker
  byte, no async SuperBlockType (sync driver in `uvrr/store.zig`)
- `trace/event.zig`, `trace.zig`, `queue.zig`, `time.zig` — dropped imports
  of the state machine / replica / fuzz closure that this tree doesn't vendor

## New (ours, TB idiom)

- `vsr.zig` — minimal `vsr` shim (checksum re-export, `Header` extern layout,
  `Release`, `Members`, `Zone` sized for the three-zone data file). NOT TB's
  vsr.zig.
- `stdx.zig` — named-module shim (`@import("stdx")` → vendored stdx dir)
- `uvrr/membership.zig` — ops WAL (add_one/remove_one/double/halve), one
  4 KiB checkpoint block, replay; modeled on TB's `src/aof.zig`
- `uvrr/store.zig` — synchronous driver over the vendored IO + quorums; the
  marker transition machine (§5.1 of `docs/uvr-durability-model.md`, the
  twin of `src/replica/reincarnation.rs`): `format` (pristine `stopped`
  copyset), `open` (the boot: 2-of-4 open quorum, higher-identity-wins
  inside the working quorum, the T2/T3 decision and its uniform 4x write,
  which is also the repair), `begin_stop`/`finish_stop` (T1, the host drain
  strictly between)
- `uvrr/capi.zig` — `pub export` C-ABI (`callconv(.C)`)
- `root.zig` — compilation root

## Build

`examples/uvr-reincarnation/build.sh` compiles `zig/root.zig` with TB's
pinned Zig 0.14.1 into `libuvrr_sb.a` (or run `zig/build.sh` for the lib only).

## Tests

Tests live with their module (the Zig convention); `root.zig` collects
them. With TB's pinned Zig 0.14.1 on PATH:

```sh
zig test -lc --dep stdx -Mroot=zig/root.zig -Mstdx=zig/stdx/stdx.zig
```

`uvrr/store.zig` carries the marker-machine corpus (the exhaustive 4⁴
marker-assignment test over the pure machine, modelled on the Rust twin's
`tests/reincarnation.rs`, plus the T1/T2/T3 disk paths through the real IO
layer); the vendored `time.zig`, `queue.zig` and `vsr/checksum.zig` tests
run unchanged. `zig build-lib` ignores test blocks.
