//! NEW  — zig/uvrr/store.zig
//!
//! Synchronous driver over the VENDORED TB IO subsystem (zig/io/*.zig — the
//! real per-OS direct block-IO layer: io_uring on linux, kqueue+F_NOCACHE on
//! darwin, IOCP on windows) and the vendored superblock quorum logic. The
//! consumer (examples/uvrr-reincarnation) is a sync C-ABI caller, so
//! completions are drained synchronously; every read and write goes through
//! TB's IO (open_data_file: O_DSYNC + F_NOCACHE + flock, F_FULLFSYNC flush on
//! darwin; O_DIRECT on linux).
//!
//! Data-file layout (see vsr.Zone): four superblock copies (superblock zone),
//! a 32 KiB membership ops WAL (8 sector-sized slots), one 4 KiB checkpoint
//! block.
//!
//! THE MARKER TRANSITION MACHINE (§5.1 of `docs/uvr-durability-model.md`;
//! the pure Rust twin `src/replica/reincarnation.rs`, whose `Marker`,
//! `classify` and `restart` this store mirrors over real IO). UVR performs
//! no disk flushes on the normal path: the superblock markers are an ordered
//! transition system, each state naming the transition that must have
//! completed for it to exist —
//!
//! ```text
//! Running ──stop──> Stopping ──drain──> Stopped ──boot, 2-of-4──> Restarting
//!                   (4x write)  flush     (4x write)              (4x write)
//!                               WALs + grids
//! Running ──crash──> (markers unchanged) ──boot, no 2-of-4 Stopped──> Joining
//!                                                        (bump, 4x write)
//! ```
//!
//! T1 — the stop command (`begin_stop`) writes `stopping` 4x; the drain —
//! the HOST flushes WALs and grids — sits STRICTLY between the two marker
//! writes; `finish_stop` writes `stopped` 4x. The marker order IS the
//! drain's proof: a `stopped` copy vouches for the WAL under it. No
//! `started` state is written: no safety logic looks for `started`, it
//! looks for `stopped` — the extra superblock write buys no safety and is
//! elided. T2 — the boot (`open`) reads the working quorum at the open
//! threshold (2-of-4) and its winning cohort's verdict: ≥2 `stopped` is
//! the clean stop, so the node continues under the same identity and
//! writes `restarting` 4x. T3 — anything else — a crash, a torn marker
//! set, or death mid-join — means the identity is dead: the node bumps it
//! and writes `joining` 4x. The word is reincarnation. Marker writes are
//! startup/shutdown-only, durable-on-write through the IO layer's sync
//! path, and are the only disk traffic outside the stop path; the boot's
//! uniform 4x write is also the repair (every disagreeing copy rewritten).
