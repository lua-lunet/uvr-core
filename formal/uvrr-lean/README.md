# uvrr-lean, Lean 4 proofs for uVRR cluster reconfiguration safety

## Crash-stop eviction (reincarnation)

uVRR forbids the classic crash-recover class: a node whose durable superblocks
record an unflushed session reopens with a NEW identity (an incarnation bump),
sends the leader a reincarnation message, and rejoins as a weight-0 standby
(a **standby** is TigerBeetle's term for its non-voting cluster members; this
README's older drafts called it a learner. Standby nodes have a zero voting weight
so cannot form part of any quorum nor actively participate in the VSR algorithm.)
Crash-Stop-Self-Evict. The classic VRR-2012 diskless quorum recovery (§4.3)
and the DISC'17 Appendix B.1 amnesia class it exposes are therefore avoided by
construction in uVRR; those mechanisms are literature about classic
crash-recovery designs, not open problems here, and the ladder carries no
crash-recovery exchange: a reincarnated node is a joiner, caught up by ordinary
state transfer. The protocol specification is [docs/uvrr-reincarnation.md](../../docs/uvrr-reincarnation.md);
the target theorem is rung 25, agreement across the two-era evict/join of a
reincarnated node under every view schedule.

## Editing the paper

Edit [../../paper/paper.tex](../../paper/paper.tex), then run `../../paper/build.sh`.
The [standalone build instructions](../../paper/README.md) require only Tectonic;
no proof harness or model service is involved. Each run publishes an
immutable, id-stamped PDF under [../../paper/papers/](../../paper/papers/).

## Verified research checkpoint, 6 September 2026

The current [LaTeX manuscript](../../paper/paper.tex) and the published PDFs under
[../../paper/papers/](../../paper/papers/) state the results through rung 20 and the
remaining end-to-end proof obligations.
The [laboratory book](LAB-BOOK.md) records commands, failures, bounded Leanstral
experiments, and commit checkpoints (its counterexample-era entries are dated
history about the classic crash-recovery attempt that reincarnation removed).
The original DOCX and rungs 1–8 remain
audit inputs; the original README is retained in baseline commit `05a4d67`.

All eight original Showboat transcripts reproduce. Rung 8 reproduces a failed
draft, rather than a proved theorem. The current ladder is:

| Rung | Module | Verified result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Structure.lean` | Finite quorum checker equivalence and a hot-swap schedule |
| 2 | `LexBallot.lean` | Well-founded lexicographic era/round order |
| 3 | `Synod.lean` | Agreement conditional on S1–S6, order and nonempty decision quorums |
| 4 | `Eras.lean` | Era-indexed reduction to the conditional agreement theorem |
| 5 | `Counterexample.lean` | Removing cross-era overlap admits disagreement under the other encoded conditions |
| 6 | `CastingVote.lean` | Conditional guard noninterference and phase-I quorum completion |
| 7 | `Weights.lean` | Concrete weighted schedule and a failing weight-change example |
| 8 | Historical Leanstral draft | Reproducible compiler failure; no proved target theorem |
| 9 | `WeightedGeneral.lean` | General finite-support scaled majority intersection; distance-two sharpness witness |
| 10 | `Acceptor.lean` | Reachable single-era promise/acceptance invariants and a guard-bypass counterexample |
| 11 | `MultiPromise.lean` | Derives `EraLe` from suffix/point promise bounds, monotone instance eras and nonempty phase-I quorums |
| 12 | `NegativeControls.lean` | Independent value-selection, promise-fencing and empty-decision witnesses; temporary source mutations |
| 13 | `ViewSelection.lean` | Executable latest-normal-view/length selection and quorum-based prefix preservation under explicit induction premises |
| 14 | `NormalLog.lean` | Fixed-view message induction derives report comparability and replica prefix retention; out-of-order delivery fault control |
| 15 | `ViewFence.lean` | Multi-view local history derives voter-report bounds; strong induction preserves committed prefixes in later activated views under explicit global provenance conditions |
| 16 | `LogProvenance.lean` | Shared multi-view transition induction proves committed-log compatibility for a fixed configuration without crashes; concrete trace and cross-view delivery control |
| 22 | `Reincarnation.lean` | Crash-Stop-Self-Evict spec rung: two-era forced weight sequence (`crossEra`/`evictEra` batches, R14 one-unit mass rule), flushed/unflushed/dirty/bumped/reincarnating state machine, continuation commitment, unit-weight three-node era-safety instances, one-era swap refusal with disjoint-majority witness; general obligations discharged in `ReincarnationGeneral.lean`, arbitrary-scale mass bounds and era safety (`forced_sequence_era_safe`), bumped-identity non-membership (`evicted_never_voting`), amnesia unreachability (`amnesia_unreachable`), continuation commitment (`forced_run_committed`, `forced_run_terminal_flushed`) |
| 23 | `CastingVoteReincarnation.lean` | Rung 6's casting vote instantiated on the reincarnation eras: two-node leader-overlap case (`{0,1}` → `{0}` meeting in the leader alone, every E0/E1 quorum pair decisive at the leader, boundary overlap through the casting-vote structure) and the honest three-node degenerate negative (forming quorums coincide, no pivot needed, none exercised); leader-contained quorum families and leader-alone phase-I quorum as general shapes |
| 24 | `ReincarnationFive.lean` | The five-voter unit-scale reincarnation rung: victim `0` returns as identity `5` through the two-era batch form; majority families computed at the concrete configs (3-of-5 strictness, dead-victim three-of-four survivor bounds, the forming quorum `{1,2,3}` a majority in all three eras); era safety by rung 22G's general discharge instantiated (`forced_sequence_era_safe`, `evicted_never_voting`); the split casting-vote verdict: E0/E1 degenerate (every formable pair meets in ≥ 2 survivors, no pivot, none needed), E1/E2 pivot genuine (`{1,2,3}` and `{3,4,5}` meet in `3` alone); doubled victim survives one legal crossing era, motivating the iterated two-unit obligation |
| 25 | `ReincarnationAgreement.lean` | Agreement across the forced sequence under every view schedule: the era family `E0, E1, E2, E2, …` satisfies P1 at arbitrary scale (`sequence_p1`: rung 9's self-overlap within an era, rung 22G's `forced_sequence_era_safe` across the two boundaries), rung 4's Theorem 10 instantiates (`sequence_agreement`); the five-node instance (`five_agreement`) with the E1/E2 leader-overlap pivot (`five_leader_overlap`) and the majority boundary: three survivors form one quorum that is a majority in every era, two form none (`five_majority_boundary`) |
| 27 | `Fuse.lean` | Finite response-quorum telescoping for the fused batch: quorum eligibility preserved through a finite configuration sequence (`eligible_through`), atomic per-node acceptance over the fused range (`AtomicAcceptance`, `ChosenEvidence`, `chosen_all`, `decide_all`), the two-transition three-voter and six-transition five-voter concrete schedules (`three_eligible`, `five_eligible`, `three_fused_chosen`, `five_fused_chosen`), the first-quorum negative control, the survivor-margin bounds and the shared-ballot era guard (`same_ballot_era_guard`); generation by `scripts/leanstral.sh` with locally repaired proof bodies |
| 28 | `Fuse.lean` | The Telescoping Theorem (`Fuse.Telescope.telescope_pass`): in a three-node cluster whose reconfiguration schedule has two transitions, `E0 → E1 → E2`, under the fuse constraints (one datagram per batch, the atomic batch property; the fuse header ballot both Phase 1 and Phase 2 for every command) the first transition passing, the response set's quorum at `E0` plus the preservation step across `E0 → E1`, telescopes the remaining slots: every slot `i ≤ 2` holds quorum-backed evidence. The equal-total-swap negative control (`swap_control`) shows the preservation hypothesis is not free; Leanstral-drafted proof body, hand-landed integration |
| 29 | `IdentityLaw.lean` | The identity law as an injectivity premise: identity assignments from (origin, life) to the durable pair `{systemId, counter}`; the lawful construction unique in both dimensions (`lawful_origin_separates`, `lawful_life_separates`, `lawful_unique`), one-indexed (`lawful_one_indexed`); the wire packing injective at any modulus wider than the counter (`pack_counter`, `pack_system`, `pack_injective`), the library u16 byte-packing instance named (`pack_wire`); three broken-mint independence witnesses in the negative-control idiom: origin-blind minting colliding across origins (`originBlind_collides`, `originBlind_not_unique`), use-before-durable recycling within one origin (`useBeforeDurable_recycles`, `useBeforeDurable_not_unique`, with the flushed counterpart `useBeforeDurable_unique_when_flushed`), and the zero read refused as no identity (`zeroRead_not_one_indexed`, `zeroRead_not_unique`); the durability ordering from the existing phase machine (`wire_requires_bump`); the weight-0 observation ruling (`weight0_not_voting`, `weight0_mass_irrelevant`, `weight0_majority_irrelevant`); Leanstral-drafted proof bodies, hand-landed integration |
| 30 | `ViewJump.lean` | The view-jump safety lemma: a view may jump by more than one during a reconfiguration without violating safety, because the safety requirements do not demand that the views of commits advance uniformly. `Rule` names the four disciplines of a legal jump (strict increase, freshness of the target, era adjacency for the non-stop path, entitlement over an accepted history containing the establishing reconfiguration); `view_jump_safe` discharges agreement at the jumped-to ballot from P1–P7 via Theorem 10, whose hypotheses never quantify over intermediate ballots (successor-by-one unrepresentable as a safety requirement); `successor_not_required` proves uniformity for successor and gap jumps from the same rule instance. Negative controls: era skip of two refused (`era_skip_not_rule`) and no two-era cross frown (`two_era_cross_frown_fails`, rung-5 majority-family idiom over five nodes); reuse refused (`self_jump_not_rule`, `enter_guard_refuses`, `enter_guard_refuses_concrete`); hand-landed, kernel-checked |
| 31 | `Witness.lean` | The telescoped-promise equivalence of the witness stream: over the witness's accept history (the `(view, accepted-prefix)` pairs the stream delivered; `Monotone` well-formedness — views strictly increase) the induced promise floor is the highest accepted view (`floor_eq_getLast`), and `telescoped_promise_equivalence` carries the three conjuncts: the P23-shaped fence over every split of the history (`fence_of_monotone`: promised at the induced floor, no later acceptance lands below it); the induced promise state equal to a member's phase-1 state at the floor view (`inducedPromiseState`, the last entry the greatest acceptance reported); and promotion consistency under H5 kept as the named hypothesis `LeaderEarned` (the floor equal to the leader's view, the committed prefix equal via `promotion_committed_prefix`). Negative controls: a witness accepting below its highest accepted view (`backslide_breaks_equivalence` — `Monotone` and the fence both fail on a concrete two-entry history) and a promotion below the leader's prefix (`short_promotion_breaks_equivalence`, the `gapped_replay_fails` idiom); hand-landed, kernel-checked |
| 32 | `BallotEncoding.lean` | The ballot-encoding ruling: a scalar host representation of the `(era, view)` ballot is sound exactly when the encoding is strictly monotone into a well-founded strict total order — the pulled-back comparison *is* `bLt` in both directions (`encodedLt_iff_bLt`, `encodedLt_eq_bLt`), so the agreement theorem's order side conditions transfer unchanged (`Synod.order_encoded`, `Paxos.theorem10_encoded`) and the ladder is representation-independent. Concrete instances: the scaled packing `era * m + view` strictly monotone below the modulus (`pack_strictMono`), the u32/u32 packing deciding `bLt` pairwise (`pack32_decides_bLt`), and the binary64 exactness horizon — eras below `2^21` at 32 view bits keep every packing below `2^53` (`pack_u32_below_f64_horizon`). Negative control: a colliding encoding defeats totality at exactly the colliding pair (`collision_not_total`), the float-rounding failure shape; hand-landed, kernel-checked |
| 33 | `CommitTelescoping.lean` | The commit direction of the fuse: per-node acceptance is downward closed (`AcceptsInOrder`, the accept path's next-slot guard), so a quorum's acceptance of a range's last slot is already its acceptance of every slot in the range (`atomic_of_last`); under a fixed configuration — the stable-leader setting, one quorum family — every slot of the range holds quorum-backed chosen evidence and is decidable (`last_acceptance_decides_all`, `commit_telescopes`), the fast-forward commit kernel: the last slot's commit authorises the intervening slots and the backup finds no gap. Negative control: a gapped responder defeats atomicity even with the last slot unanimous (`gap_breaks_atomicity`); hand-landed, kernel-checked |

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.elan/bin:$PATH"
cd formal/uvrr-lean
showboat verify REPRODUCE.md
```

[REPRODUCE.md](REPRODUCE.md) is the single executable reproduction document:
exact tool versions, the library build, the axiom audit, every rung replay,
the mutation controls, the two TLC runs from a hash-pinned jar, the Rust
gates, the paper build and input digests.
`showboat extract REPRODUCE.md` emits the shell commands that recreate it.
The individual rungs can still be replayed one at a time:

```sh
lake build
python3 check_axioms.py
for f in ladder/[0-9][0-9]-*.md; do showboat verify "$f" || exit; done
python3 check_mutations.py
```

The broad glob includes rungs numbered 10 and above. The axiom audit queries
every named theorem, definition and abbreviation in the compiled project
sources. Only `propext`, `Quot.sound`, and `Classical.choice` are allowed.

Two corrections to the baseline wording are essential: the cross-era witness
proves that removing overlap admits inconsistency in the abstract contract;
it does not prove that every conceivable scheme without overlap is unsafe.
And passing the entire ladder is not yet an end-to-end uVRR or VRR-2012 proof.
Whole-log view selection, repeated operational
reconfiguration, client linearizability and progress remain integration work.

## Proof tooling

The formalization is written in plain Lean 4 with Mathlib as build-time
proof tooling. Solvers and automation were surveyed before the work began;
what contributed and what did not:

- omega, built into Lean, zero install, routinely used.
- Aesop, exercised (4/4 propositional theorems solved). Not a dependency
  of the formalization. Record: `study/lean-solvers-cli-omega-aesop.md`.
- lean-auto / Duper, exercised (2/3 theorems solved, T2 commutativity timed
  out at 500 s). Not a dependency. Record:
  `study/lean-solvers-cli-lean-auto.md`.
- Veil, never tire-kicked: it pins v4.32.0 and pulls Mathlib, and the
  formalization uses plain Lean by design. Record:
  the archived tree at tag dumpster-before-paper-reorg, `study/outcomes-paper.md`.
- LeanLTL, never exercised beyond checkout: past-time operators remain
  future work. Record: `study/outcomes-paper.md`.

None of these are submodules. Experiment records live under `study/`;
do not re-add the tools as submodules.
