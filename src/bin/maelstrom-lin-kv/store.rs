//! The bench host's state file: the durable evidence a restart reopens
//! under (`docs/uvr-protocols.md`, the reincarnation chapter §2), carried in the host's own
//! store.
//!
//! # Shape (format 3, bench-internal; no cross-version compatibility)
//!
//! One file per node under the state dir, keyed by the node's Maelstrom
//! id:
//!
//! ```text
//! [ header slot A ][ header slot B ][ journal entries, appended in slot order ]
//! ```
//!
//! The journal region is append-only: each newly journaled entry is
//! encoded once, a `u32` length frame and the core's own wire codec
//! packs the [`LogEntry`], so the host invents no second codec for
//! history it did not define, appended at the active header's byte
//! cursor and fsynced. The header is a fixed-size slot holding exactly
//! what a restart must decide from: the four-superblock copies of §2,
//! the genesis roster, the §5 persisted progress record, and the
//! journal region's base slot, entry count and byte length. Committing
//! a transition writes the INACTIVE slot, a monotone sequence number
//! and a checksum over the slot, and fsyncs it. The slot is the
//! commit point.
//!
//! Two slots, alternating: a torn slot write (a crash between the write
//! and its fsync) fails the slot's checksum and the loader falls back
//! to the other slot, the last committed state, never a torn read and
//! never a bricked node. Bytes the active slot does not count, a torn
//! append, or the dead tail a view-change install replaced, are not
//! durable evidence: the loader reads exactly the counted prefix, and
//! the next append overwrites the rest.
//!
//! # The write-through barrier (§7)
//!
//! Per published transition: the new entries are appended and fsynced
//! FIRST, the header slot is written and fsynced SECOND, and only then
//! does the host route the released effects, durable before
//! observable, so a kill loses at most the in-flight input. A storage
//! failure at either step is determinate: the node stops (exit
//! nonzero, Jepsen restarts it from the last committed slot) rather
//! than serve on a store it cannot vouch for.
//!
//! # The uncommitted tail (§9.2)
//!
//! Acceptances append at the tail. A view-change install REPLACES the
//! divergent uncommitted tail ([`uvrr::journal::Journal::install_suffix`]),
//! and an installed history can be shorter than the one it replaces.
//! The committed prefix never changes under the node's feet: every
//! shared slot of an offered suffix is checked, and a disagreement at
//! or below the committed frontier is a fault, never an install (the
//! core's `check_suffix`, §9.1), so the store's per-transition work
//! compares only the uncommitted tail `(committed, frontier]`, entry
//! digests against the durable mirror. Matching slots stand; the
//! lowest mismatch truncates the durable region below it and the
//! replaced tail re-appends. Steady state, the walk is the in-flight
//! window and the write is the new entries, O(new) per transition; an
//! install pays only the tail it actually diverges on.
//!
//! The bench never reclaims (`S1` allows it), so the retained window's
//! base is stable; a base that moves is a named refusal, never a
//! re-basing guess. The first life builds the whole file once, temp
//! file, fsync, atomic rename, fsync of the directory, the §7 [`uvrr::effects::Stability::Forced`]
//! barrier shape, and the reopen path (§2) reads the active slot and
//! its counted prefix. A file no slot of which vouches for itself, a
//! short journal region, or a malformed frame is a crash artifact,
//! answered with the core's reopen refusal path: a named refusal and a
//! nonzero exit, never a panic. Absence is the provisioning case: no
//! file, first life.
