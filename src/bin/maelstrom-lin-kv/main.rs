//! Maelstrom node that runs the unmodified VRR replication core against the
//! `lin-kv` workload, so Knossos can check the protocol for linearizability
//! under Maelstrom's partition / kill / pause nemeses.
//!
//! The core is used as a Rust library ([`uvrr::replica::Replica`]), planner
//! architecture: every event becomes a [`uvrr::replica::TimedInput`], [`uvrr::replica::Replica::plan`]
//! computes a transition against the published state and a journal view, and
//! this host publishes it with [`uvrr::replica::Replica::publish`] and executes the released
//! effects. The host owns time, transport, storage and the application,
//! exactly the split the core is written against.
//!
//! Architecture: two producer threads (stdin reader, ticker) feed one
//! channel; a single core thread owns all state and is the only writer to
//! stdout, so there is no lock around the replica.
//!
//! # Durability: two modes, one host
//!
//! The bench host has two durability modes, fixed by the environment at
//! init:
//!
//! - **Volatile, the default.** `MAELSTROM_UVRR_STATE_DIR` unset or
//!   empty: no store at all, no file is opened, written or fsynced, and
//!   every construction takes the [`uvrr::effects::Stability::Volatile`] provision path:
//!   first boot or kill-nemesis restart alike provisions fenced
//!   [`uvrr::lifecycle::Marker::Joining`] (the genesis ruling, §1.3), and a node becomes [`uvrr::progress::Status::Normal`]
//!   only through the bootstrap adoption (the reincarnation chapter §4). A voter whose volatile
//!   state vanished while retaining authority is unrepresentable in this
//!   host: a restarted node rejoins fenced, and the next view change
//!   deposes any stale primary. A kill loses the process's state; the
//!   survivors inside the fault bound keep serving.
//! - **Persisted, opt-in.** `MAELSTROM_UVRR_STATE_DIR` set: the state dir
//!   is the persistence home, and the write-through barrier and the
//!   marker machine below govern it. The state file carries exactly
//!   what the core considers durable: the §5 persisted progress record,
//!   the journal's retained history, and the boot-gate chapter §2 four-superblock
//!   identity the marker machine transitions. A kill loses at most the
//!   in-flight input; every effect the client or a peer ever observed
//!   rests on a file the host fsynced first.
//!
//! # The persisted mode's write-through (§7)
//!
//! In both modes the node runs [`uvrr::effects::Stability::Volatile`], the core's
//! statement that effects release at `publish`. In the persisted mode the
//! host enforces the durability ordering itself, between publish and
//! observability: after every published transition the host rewrites the
//! node's state file (temp file, fsync, atomic rename, fsync of the
//! directory, the §7 [`uvrr::effects::Stability::Forced`] barrier shape) and only then routes any
//! released effect.
//!
//! The stability handshake stays [`uvrr::effects::Stability::Volatile`] because it is the only level
//! whose contract this host can discharge honestly: every other level parks
//! each transition behind an [`uvrr::effects::Effect::Persist`] intent, and the parked
//! transition, the would-be durable state the host would have to write,
//! is not observable through the core's public surface (the plan's candidate
//! and journal mutation are consumed by `publish`; PublishOutcome::Parked
//! releases only the intent's revision and ranges). A host outside the
//! crate cannot build the state it would be confirming, so the core's
//! parked protocol cannot be selected without confirming a barrier the host
//! cannot actually build. The honest equivalent is the host-side barrier
//! above: same ordering, enforced where the effects become observable.
//! (Reported core limitation, not papered over.)
//!
//! # The marker machine (the persisted mode's restart discipline)
//!
//! In the persisted mode the state dir is the persistence home, and the
//! state file's four superblock copies are the core's marker transition
//! machine, the host invents no rule, it writes the markers exactly
//! where the machine puts them (startup and shutdown only; the
//! write-through below carries them untouched in between):
//!
//! - **T1, a clean stop (stdin EOF):** [`uvrr::lifecycle::SuperblockCopies::begin_stop`]
//!   writes [`uvrr::lifecycle::Marker::Stopping`] 4x, durable; the host then drains, flushes the
//!   WALs and grids, this store's one state file its own WAL and grid,
//!   so the drain is the file's fsync, strictly between the marker
//!   writes; [`uvrr::lifecycle::SuperblockCopies::finish_stop`] writes [`uvrr::lifecycle::Marker::Stopped`] 4x. The
//!   marker order is the drain's proof: a [`uvrr::lifecycle::Marker::Stopped`] copy vouches for the
//!   WAL under it.
//! - **T2, a clean restart.** A boot whose quorum read (the lifecycle
//!   gate's classification) sees 2-of-4 [`uvrr::lifecycle::Marker::Stopped`] has the transition's
//!   proof, the drain completed, no amnesiac risk, so the node
//!   continues under the same identity and the gate latches [`uvrr::lifecycle::Marker::Restarting`]
//!   4x; the [`uvrr::lifecycle::Vouched`] token it mints is the only same-identity resume.
//! - **T3, a resurrect.** No stopped quorum, a crash, a torn marker
//!   set, or death mid-join, means the identity is dead: the gate's
//!   `Bumped` pair is the commitment and the host reopens under the
//!   bumped identity through [`uvrr::replica::Replica::reincarnate`], reporting
//!   `Input::Reincarnate { old }`,
//!   from which point the core's reincarnation machinery owns the
//!   restart: the announcement (the reincarnation chapter §4), the leader's forced weight
//!   sequence (the reincarnation chapter §5, one era per batch), and the re-announce this host
//!   re-drives on every tick until the identity is a voting member
//!   again (the reincarnation chapter §8).
//!
//! A first life writes its boot markers ([`uvrr::lifecycle::Marker::Joining`], the genesis
//! incarnation) before `init_ok` is answered, and a running node's
//! markers hold its boot write until the next clean stop, so a kill
//! leaves exactly the no-controlled-shutdown evidence the next boot
//! needs.
//!
//! The bump's durable [`uvrr::lifecycle::Marker::Joining`] write DEFERS to the engine's seated
//! observation (`docs/uvr-io-obligations.md`, the boot-gate chapter §3, the flush is never paid at
//! the boundary of an uninitialised start): the announcement carries the
//! pair while the markers still hold the state as loaded, and the latch
//! fires, over the then-current running state, once the reincarnated
//! identity is [`uvrr::progress::Status::Normal`] at voting weight. The re-crash replay makes the
//! deferral safe: a crash before the latch re-reads the old markers,
//! re-classifies crashed, and re-decides the same pair (the bump is a
//! pure function of the quorum-resolved identity), and the announcement
//! is idempotent at the leader (the reincarnation chapter §4), so the replay is absorbed.
//!
//! Torn or corrupt state files are crash artifacts, not inputs: the host
//! refuses the reopen by name (the core's [`uvrr::replica::LifecycleRefusal`] path),
//! answers `error`, and exits nonzero so Jepsen restarts the node. Never
//! a panic.
//!
//! # Identity mapping (host-side, transparent to Maelstrom)
//!
//! The core's [`uvrr::ids::NodeId`] is the durable pair (`docs/uvr-io-obligations.md`, the boot-gate chapter §5):
//! the system half names the node, the crash-counter half names the life;
//! the Maelstrom transport names a fixed roster. The host maps between
//! them ([`Identity`]): a genesis identity is the sorted-roster position
//! as the system half with counter one, a bumped identity is the same
//! system half with the counter one past, and the system half always
//! resolves a core identity back to the Maelstrom node string it
//! reincarnated under. A `Reincarnation(old, new)` announcement remaps the
//! sender's transport id onto the announced new identity (§6's attribution
//! rule, enforced host-side); before an announcement arrives, traffic from
//! a restarted node is attributed to its genesis identity, the boot fence
//! and the durable identity the node carries make that the same stance the
//! provision-fresh host already took, and the announcement closes it.
//!
//! # Time (S4)
//!
//! The core reads no clock; the host owns time. This host's clock is a
//! single `u64` counter, bumped once per driven input and carried as
//! [`uvrr::replica::TimedInput::at`].
//!
//! # Membership verbs (§8.7)
//!
//! Four Maelstrom message kinds drive cluster making through the core's
//! public [`uvrr::replica::Input::Reconfigure`] path, the §8.7.2 pre-proposal gates are
//! the core's, and every core refusal becomes a named Maelstrom `error`,
//! never a crash:
//!
//! - `join {node_id}`, admit an already-running bench node at weight 0
//!   ([`uvrr::configuration::SystemOperation::Join`], stop-the-world). The bench roster is fixed
//!   by `node_ids`, so a join naming an id outside the roster is refused by
//!   the host (`malformed-request`, code 12) before the core is touched; a
//!   join of a member the configuration already holds is refused by the
//!   fold itself.
//! - `promote {node_id}`, one weight step toward voting
//!   ([`uvrr::configuration::SystemOperation::Increment`]); takes the §8.7.6 pivot when one
//!   exists for this leader, and falls back to stop-the-world when the
//!   leader is non-pivotal, a latency outcome, not an error.
//! - `demote {node_id}`, one weight step down ([`uvrr::configuration::SystemOperation::Decrement`],
//!   stop-the-world).
//! - `leave {node_id}`, remove a weight-0 member ([`uvrr::configuration::SystemOperation::Leave`],
//!   stop-the-world); the canonical departure is `demote` to 0 then `leave`
//!   of the same node.
//!
//! A verb is a client RPC like any other: a node that does not lead
//! forwards it once, exactly as the lin-kv path does. The reply is not the
//! proposal's: it leaves when the establishing operation COMMITS and the
//! era folds on this node (§8.7.1), and every reply, `*_ok` or `error`,
//! echoes the node's current configuration view: the established era, the
//! current view, and the member order with weights. A refusal is definite
//! (the gates run before the proposal; the operation never entered the
//! log); a verb whose establishing operation dies uncommitted in a view
//! change gets no reply at all, which is the honest indeterminate.
