//! Configuration, era, membership, voting weights, and reconfiguration operations.
//!
//! Spec §8.7.1 (configuration), §8.7.2 (reconfiguration operations), §8.7.5 (closure of
//! weighted-majority configurations), §8.7.6 (pivot condition), §8.7.7 (non-stop
//! transition), §8.7.8 (primary failure during overlap mode); and
//! `docs/uvr-protocols.md`, the reconfiguration-rules chapter §1–§4 (the command alphabet and its
//! boundaries, R1–R15), §9 (the snapshot and the operation WAL).
//!
//! A configuration is an era, an ordered member list, and a non-negative integer weight
//! per member. Primary selection is `config(era).order[view mod len(order)]`. Weight
//! zero grants no voting authority, so a newly joined member is a learner until a later
//! committed [`SystemOperation::Increment`] promotes it, which is what makes state transfer a precondition
//! of authority rather than a courtesy.
//!
//! # The weight domain {0, 1, 2} (rules §1, R1)
//!
//! Voting weights are common factors: any uniform scaling is a zero effect on quorums,
//! so no node ever needs a weight above [`MAX_WEIGHT`] and no operation may produce any
//! other value, the fold refuses. A weight-0 member is a **learner**: it never votes
//! and is counted against no quorum (rules §2, R4), which is what makes [`SystemOperation::Join`] and
//! [`SystemOperation::Leave`] at weight zero safe, neither changes any quorum family, so neither needs an
//! overlap argument.
//!
//! # The operation alphabet, the batch, and the era rule (rules §3–§4, R7–R15)
//!
//! Reconfiguration operations (`VOID`, `INIT`, `JOIN`, `LEAVE`, `INCREMENT`,
//! `DECREMENT`, `DOUBLE`, `HALVE`, `NOMINATE`) are replicated history, not ambient
//! state, so initial configuration construction is itself reconstructible from that
//! history. One reconfiguration commits a
//! [`SystemOperation::Batch`]: operations applied together, in order, establishing one
//! era. A batch containing [`SystemOperation::Double`] or [`SystemOperation::Halve`] contains nothing else (R13); every other
//! batch is a unit batch moving at most one unit of per-node mass (R14); genesis and
//! nested batches are refused (R15). A `NOMINATE` rides a batch as a zero-mass
//! passenger and never occupies a slot of its own
//! (`docs/uvr-protocols.md`, the NOMINATE chapter). The planner that partitions an operation
//! stream into legal batches is [`crate::reconfiguration`].
//!
//! The relation `era(view) + 1 >= era(slot) >= era(view)` bounds which configuration may
//! authorize a slot. The `+1` case is overlap mode: an era-`e` view committing operations
//! against the era-`e+1` replication quorum.
//!
//! Failure to construct the §8.7.6 pivot is **not** a protocol fault. A low-weight
//! primary may have no legal split; the core falls back to the ordinary stop-the-world
//! view change. Treating a missing pivot as an error would make weight assignment a
//! correctness concern for the host instead of a latency concern.
//!
//! # Era assignment
//!
//! [`SystemOperation::Void`] establishes era 0, [`SystemOperation::Init`] establishes era 1, and every subsequent accepted
//! operation, single or [`SystemOperation::Batch`], establishes `era + 1`. Era `e` is
//! therefore established by the `(e+1)`-th committed configuration operation, and
//! §8.7.8's rule that a replica may propose era `e` only if it holds the operation
//! establishing `e` is checkable by construction: era and establishing operation are in
//! one-to-one correspondence, so there is no bookkeeping to drift.
//!
//! # Persistence (rules §9)
//!
//! Nothing here is mutated. [`Configuration::apply`] folds one configuration into the
//! next and [`EraTable::extend`] returns a new table that shares the retained `Arc`s
//! with its receiver, so later consumers can hand configuration history out by `Arc`
//! without copying and without locking. The durable record is a [`Snapshot`] plus a WAL
//! of [`SystemOperation`] values, the WAL payload type, and replay is the fold.
