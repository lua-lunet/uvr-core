//! Identity: node identifiers, view identifiers, slots, operation identities.
//!
//! Spec §1.2 (view and configuration generation), §1.3 (slots and frontiers), and
//! decision W1.
//!
//! A view is an explicit `Ballot { era: u32, view: u32 }`.
//!
//! Identifiers are supplied by the host (decision W2): [`OperationId`] is 128
//! host-chosen bits the core carries opaque. The core never mints one, so it needs
//! no randomness source and no `uuid` dependency; correlation is whatever the
//! host's naming discipline says it is.
//!
//! Ordering on identifiers is total and lexicographic in `(era, view)`, because the
//! higher-view rule of §10 must be decidable from the header alone, without consulting
//! configuration state that a boot-fenced replica may not yet hold.
//!
//! # Why newtypes rather than aliases
//!
//! `type View = u32` is naming, not typing: it lets a slot be passed where a view is
//! expected, and the resulting bug is a silent safety violation rather than a type
//! error. Each identifier below is a distinct `#[repr(transparent)]` newtype, so the
//! confusion is rejected at compile time while the C ABI still passes the
//! value as the bare primitive with no marshalling layer to disagree with itself. The
//! `const` layout assertions exist so a later added field or changed repr is a
//! compile error here rather than an ABI break discovered by a host.
//!
//! # Why every successor returns `Option`
//!
//! §8.7.3 forbids wraparound outright. A wrapped view number reuses a primary term and
//! a wrapped slot reuses a log position; both are unrecoverable divergence, not a
//! recoverable error. There is therefore no `+ 1`, no `wrapping_*`, and no `as` cast
//! between integer widths anywhere in this module: the exhaustion of a 32-bit view
//! space is a state the caller must handle explicitly.
//!
//! # Why no `Default`
//!
//! [`Era`], [`View`], [`Slot`], [`NodeId`] and [`Tick`] deliberately do not implement `Default`.
//! A defaulted identifier is a value nobody chose, and any of these can reach a journal
//! record or a published [`crate::progress::Progress`] (§5), where "zero because nobody set it" and "zero
//! because that is the genesis value" are indistinguishable after the fact. Where a base
//! value is genuinely meaningful it is a named constant with documented meaning:
//! [`Era::INITIAL`], [`View::INITIAL`], [`Slot::NONE`]. [`NodeId`] and [`Tick`] get none,
//! because no node identifier is privileged (§8.7.1: `order` is host-assigned) and no
//! tick is (S4: every tick comes from the host).
//!
//! # Why the serde derives are `cfg_attr` and not `derive`
//!
//! Each type below carries `#[cfg_attr(feature = "serde", derive(...))]` so the default
//! build contains no trace of serde and a consumer's non-optional dependency set stays
//! empty (W3, enforced by `tests/manifest_contract.rs`). Serde exists for a host that
//! wants its own encoding and for the `maelstrom` debug bridge. It is never the wire
//! format: the normative encoding is the binary codec in [`crate::wire`], because only a
//! fixed-width encoding makes the §13.1 suffix budget an exact sum (W4).
