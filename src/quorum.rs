//! Quorum families by semantic role, and the [`QuorumStrategy`] extension point.
//!
//! Spec §8.1 (baseline majority), §8.2 (families, not counts), §8.3 (diskless overlap),
//! §8.4 (weighted quorums), §8.5 (even-sized configurations), §8.6 (reconfiguration
//! overlap), §8.7.5 (closure). Decision Q1.
//!
//! Quorums are named by role, not by size: `C_g` commit, `V_g` view change, `F_g`
//! [`crate::wire::Tag::StartViewChange`] fence, `R_g` restart. Distinguishing the roles is what lets a host
//! adopt the §8.5 even-node split (`V_g = k+1`, `C_g = k`) or a §8.4 weighted family
//! without editing the protocol.
//!
//! [`QuorumStrategy`] is an extension point; the intersection obligations it must satisfy
//! are not. The obligations, `R1: QI_e ⌢ QII_e` and `R2: QI_e ⌢ QII_(e+1)` (§8.7.4),
//! plus the diskless `F_g ⌢ R_g` and `V_g ⌢ V_g` (§8.3), are discharged by
//! [`validate_era`] and [`validate_transition`], **free functions the core calls**, not
//! trait methods. That placement is the Q1 ruling made concrete: a strategy value
//! decides only [`QuorumStrategy::is_quorum`], and no strategy, feature flag or host
//! can override, skip or weaken the gate, because the gate is not part of the thing a
//! host supplies.
//!
//! The discharge is exhaustive subset enumeration over the membership, using the
//! complement identity: two families fail to intersect iff some quorum of one has a
//! complement that is a quorum of the other. Every refusal carries the **witness**,
//! the two disjoint subsets that violate the obligation, because a refusal that
//! cannot show the operator *why* is a refusal nobody can act on.
//! [`configuration::MAX_MEMBERS`] bounds the enumeration at `2^16` predicate
//! evaluations, which is what makes the cap a validation-cost bound rather than a
//! protocol limit.
//!
//! We ship [`WeightedMajority`] as the default because §8.7.5 proves its closure across
//! consecutive eras, and the extension point is exercised, not merely declared: the
//! test suites drive their own `Thresholds` and `AnythingQuorums` implementations
//! against the same gate, which is what keeps it more than a promise. Shipping only
//! a default would leave the extension point
//! unexercised and therefore unproven.
//!
//! We ship a default and a trait. We do not ship a choice.
