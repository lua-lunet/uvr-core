///    restart, or a [`crate::wire::Tag::DoViewChange`]/[`crate::wire::Tag::StartView`]/[`crate::wire::Tag::NewState`] peer message.
/// 4. **Revision**: exactly +1, so a stale plan is rejected by comparison (§12).
/// 5. **Sticky fault** (§5 invariant 5, S3): a faulted `old` admits no `new` at
///    all, and the reported fault is the existing one.
/// 6. **Era/slot discipline** (§8.7.3, W1): the era authorising `accepted` is
