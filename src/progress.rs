//! The [`Progress`] record and its cross-strategy invariants.
//!
//! Spec §5 and §1.3, §6 for the transition, §12 for the publication interval, and
//! decision W1 for the view identity. Decision B1 owns the observation half: see
//! [`ProgressSnapshot`] and [`crate::observe`].
//!
//! [`Progress`] is the compact protocol record `(current_view, retained_view, status,
//! accepted, committed, applied, checkpoint, fault)` plus the configuration history
//! that authorises it and a `revision` counter. It is immutable: every transition
//! produces a new value, and which fields survive a local crash is a property of the
//! host's declared durability profile, not of this type.
//!
//! # The invariant set, checked on every construction
//!
//! Constructors and transitions are the only way in, and each validates the **full**
//! invariant set on its result, not only the field it changed. The checker is cheap;
//! the alternative is trusting the caller, and a [`Progress`] that violates these must
//! be unrepresentable through the public API:
//!
//! - the §1.3 frontier chain `checkpoint <= applied <= committed <= accepted`;
//! - the §1.3 status/view relations: [`Status::Normal`] requires `current == retained`;
//!   [`Status::ViewChange`] requires `current >= retained`; the fenced entry states
//!   [`Status::Restarting`], [`Status::Joining`], and [`Status::Replaying`]
//!   carry no relation, because in them `current` is not an authority to
//!   participate;
//! - era/slot discipline (§8.7.3, W1): the era authorising `accepted` is
//!   `era(current)` or `era(current) + 1`, the `+1` case is overlap mode;
//! - `fault` is sticky (§5 invariant 5): a faulted value admits no transition.
//!
//! `revision` increases by exactly one per published transition and exists for
//! stale-plan rejection: §12 serialises the transition interval, so a plan computed
//! against revision `r` is publishable only while the published state is still at
//! revision `r`. Exactly one transition is ever outstanding.
//!
//! # Why a fault is sticky
//!
//! A fault means the node can no longer say what its own durable state is (S3: only
//! an *indeterminate* persistence result faults; a determinate failure leaves the
//! published state visible). A node that has lost track of its durable state cannot
//! be the authority that declares itself sound again, so no transition clears a
//! fault and the replica refuses all further input (§5 invariant 5, §12's
//! `Indeterminate persistence result -> Faulted`). Re-entering the protocol is a
//! host lifecycle event, a controlled start over vouched durable state, or
//! reincarnation after a crash (`docs/uvr-io-obligations.md`, the boot-gate chapter §1: a start is not a
//! recovery), not a state transition the core performs on itself.
//!
//! `status` is process control as well as protocol state. A reopened node that has
//! not proved its state current starts fenced and restarting, whatever status was
//! last observed before failure, which is why [`Progress::genesis`] is
//! [`Status::Joining`] and not [`Status::Normal`]. The pre-failure status is evidence
//! about the past, not authority over the present; [`Progress::reconstitute`]
//! accepts any status because it restores *evidence*, and downgrading that evidence
//! to a fenced start is the replica's boot rule (§5), not a property of the
//! record.
