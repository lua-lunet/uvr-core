//! The flavoured-timeout model: given a state, a clock, and an admin policy
//! that an unknown waiting time is exceeded, what may the node do.
//!
//! A node's timeout is a local clock event on a single-threaded host timer.
//! Its duration is never prescribed, may be dynamic, and is host policy, not
//! protocol: the core reads no clock (S4, `docs/uvr-durability-model.md`
//! §13.2), and a duration belongs to the host the way
//! [`crate::replica::ViewChangeKnobs::primary_timeout`] does. What the node may DO when the
//! waiting time is exceeded is protocol, and this module is that answer as a
//! total function: the state enum and the timeout enum are closed, the
//! matcher is exhaustive over every pair with no default arm, and a new
//! variant cannot enter either enum without the matcher being revisited.
//!
//! The matcher returns opinions, not prose: the legal family is retransmit,
//! do nothing, heartbeat, or start a view change. A delay never panics: a
//! stall that may clear is the operator's business, and for the states
//! outside the protocol's proof the matcher returns [`Opinion::Sorry`]
//! carrying the runbook statement rather than faulting the node over time it
//! does not own.

/// A node's protocol condition. The states are finite and the enum is
/// exhaustive; a new state cannot enter without the matcher being revisited.
