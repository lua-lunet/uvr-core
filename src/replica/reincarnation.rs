//! Reincarnation: the Crash-Stop-Self-Evict production logic
//! (`docs/uvr-protocols.md`, the reincarnation chapter).
//!
//! Three pieces live here, each the code of one section of that document:
//!
//! * **The forced weight sequence** (§5; rules §6): given a committed
//!   configuration and the announced `(old, new)` pair, the remaining
//!   eras the leader must commit, the §6 table computed for the old
//!   identity's observed state, each era ONE [`crate::configuration::SystemOperation::Batch`] establishing
//!   operation: the old identity's weight driven to 0 by unit decrements
//!   (the subtract-one rule, always era-safe), the crossing batch
//!   `[Decrement(old), Join(new)]`, the promotion batch
//!   `[Increment(new), Leave(old)]` (a zero-weight [`crate::configuration::SystemOperation::Leave`] changes no
//!   quorum family), and for an old identity already at 0 or already
//!   evicted the join/promotion form the table names. Steps the observed
//!   eras already committed are not re-run: the announcement is idempotent
//!   over the current configuration, which is what makes a leader crash
//!   mid-sequence harmless (§8), whichever safe era the crash lands in,
//!   the next leader recomputes the remaining eras from the configuration
//!   that era committed.
//! * **The leader machine**: the pair the announcement armed, and the
//!   tick-driven continuation that proposes the next step through the
//!   ordinary reconfiguration pipeline, one establishing operation at a
//!   time, each commit a distinct era (§5), every step gated by the same
//!   closed gates any host-proposed operation passes.
//! * **The marker transition machine** (`docs/uvr-io-obligations.md`, the boot-gate chapter §2, the boot decision of `docs/uvr-protocols.md`, the reincarnation chapter §1): the pure Rust twin
//!   of the vendored TigerBeetle store (`zig/uvrr/store.zig`). The four
//!   superblock markers are an ordered transition system,
//!   `Running ──stop──> Stopping ──drain──> Stopped ──boot, 2-of-4──>
//!   Restarting`, and `Running ──crash──> (markers unchanged) ──boot, no
//!   2-of-4 Stopped──> Joining`, each state naming the transition that must
//!   have completed for it to exist. UVR performs **no disk flushes on the
//!   normal path**: the stop command writes [`crate::lifecycle::Marker::Stopping`] 4x
//!   ([`crate::lifecycle::SuperblockCopies::begin_stop`]), the HOST drains, flushes WALs and
//!   grids, strictly between the two marker writes, and
//!   [`crate::lifecycle::SuperblockCopies::finish_stop`] writes [`crate::lifecycle::Marker::Stopped`] 4x; the marker order
//!   is the drain's proof, so a [`crate::lifecycle::Marker::Stopped`] copy vouches for the WAL under it.
//!   At boot the quorum read answers one question, *did the transition
//!   complete?*, with 2-of-4 copies holding [`crate::lifecycle::Marker::Stopped`] (the twin's open
//!   threshold), the working quorum resolving the identity
//!   higher-identity-wins INSIDE the quorum: a stopped quorum continues under
//!   the same identity and writes [`crate::lifecycle::Marker::Restarting`] 4x, a member with complete
//!   state, no amnesia, ticking the full protocol; no stopped quorum, a
//!   crash, a torn marker set, or death mid-join, means the identity is
//!   dead: the node bumps it and reincarnates, writing [`crate::lifecycle::Marker::Joining`] 4x, not a
//!   member, no vote, no view change. No `Started` state is written: no
//!   safety logic looks for `Started`, it looks for [`crate::lifecycle::Marker::Stopped`], the extra
//!   superblock write buys no safety and is elided. The marker writes are
//!   durable-on-write (flushed), the only disk traffic outside the stop
//!   path.
