//! The replica: the two-phase transition pipeline, the lifecycle, and the
//! stability handshake.
//!
//! Spec §5 (progress record), §6 (functional core model), §7 (serialized
//! transition interval and stability levels), §11 (application boundary), §12
//! (concurrency contract). Decisions S2
//! (plan/publish/confirm), S3 (three-way stability), S4 (the tick is host
//! observation metadata), B1 (observation on publish only), W1 (era in every header), Q1
//! (the quorum gate runs at construction).
//!
//! The load-bearing property of the whole design: **nothing externally
//! observable is released before publication**. `plan` computes a candidate and
//! releases nothing, not an effect, not an observation write, not a journal
//! mutation. `publish` runs the closed [`crate::invariant::legal`] gate, and only then installs
//! the candidate, writes the observation, and releases the effects, or, in an
//! external-stability mode, emits the [`PersistenceIntent`] and parks
//! everything else until the host's [`crate::effects::StabilityResult`] arrives as an ordinary
//! serialized input (S2). Observation changes on publish, never on plan (B1).
//!
//! The transition is total and pure:
//!
//! ```text
//! tick + message + state -> state + list(messages)
//! ```
//!
//! No clock read occurs anywhere beneath this module. Every input carries the
//! host tick (S4). [`Input::Tick`] exists as an ordinary event, not as a
//! timer callback, so a harness can replay sloppy, late, early and reordered
//! timeouts deterministically, a timeout the core cannot be *told* about is a
//! timeout no test can reproduce.
//!
//! [`crate::effects::StabilityResult`] is three-way (decision S3): `Stable { receipt }`,
//! `Failed { reason }`, `Indeterminate { reason }`. Only [`crate::effects::StabilityResult::Indeterminate`]
//! sticky-faults the node. A determinate failure leaves the previously
//! published state visible and observable, because collapsing "it definitely
//! did not happen" into "it might have happened" throws away exactly the
//! information that distinguishes a retry from a fresh episode.
//!
//! Dispatch over inputs is exhaustive `match` with no wildcard arms. An input
//! whose handler is future work is refused with the named, tested
//! by the named refusal the input class earns, never a silent no-op, never a placeholder
//! handler.
//!
//! # Normal operation
//!
//! VRR-2012 §4 is live: [`crate::wire::Tag::Prepare`]/[`crate::wire::Tag::PrepareOk`]/[`crate::wire::Tag::Commit`] with
//! commit-frontier piggybacking (§13.3), the Propose/Apply/Applied boundary
//! (§11.1), and the bootstrap from the fenced [`crate::progress::Status::Joining`] genesis state (the
//! ruling is on the Replica::plan_tick handler). Every handler is total: invalid peer
//! input is dropped with a named [`Diagnostic`] on the observation, never
//! faults the node; faulting stays reserved for impossible LOCAL transitions
//! via `invariant::legal`. Quorum decisions go through the
//! [`crate::quorum::QuorumStrategy`] ([`crate::quorum::Role::Commit`]) and nowhere else (Q1).
//!
//! # View change
//!
//! VRR-2012 §5 is live: tick-driven timeout detection (S4, the knob is
//! [`ViewChangeKnobs::primary_timeout`], and only same-view [`crate::wire::Tag::Prepare`]/[`crate::wire::Tag::Commit`]
//! from the legitimate primary count as activity), the [`crate::wire::Tag::StartViewChange`]
//! fence ([`crate::quorum::Role::Fence`] through the strategy, Q1), [`crate::wire::Tag::DoViewChange`] evidence
//! ([`crate::quorum::Role::ViewChange`]), and [`crate::wire::Tag::StartView`] installation. History selection
//! ranks by `retained` view first, then `accepted` frontier (§1.3), the
//! §9.2 counterexample is the load-bearing test of the rule. Suffixes are
//! bounded newest-first under [`ViewChangeKnobs::view_change_budget`] and
//! encoded ascending (§13.1; W4: [`crate::wire::Pack::packed_len`] is normative, never
//! exceeded by a byte). A [`crate::wire::Tag::StartView`] suffix that conflicts with a committed
//! local slot is the view-change path's one deliberate fault-on-peer-input: silent
//! repair would hide a safety breach, so the node declares
//! [`crate::ids::Fault::IllegalTransition`]. A suffix the recipient cannot construct
//! history from is a named gap, [`crate::observe::Diagnostic::GapDetected`], never a
//! fault, whose fetch half (§10, §13.1 step 5) rides the same
//! transition: a [`crate::wire::Tag::GetState`] for the missing range, and the installed
//! chunks re-run the stalled ruling.
//!
//! # The application boundary (§11.1, B2)
//!
//! The core orders opaque operations and nothing else. A host proposal
//! carries an [`crate::ids::OperationId`] the proposing host assigns; the core replicates
//! it inside the log entry, never inspects it, and never deduplicates on it,
//! the same identity proposed twice is two operations, at two slots, applied
//! twice. Commitment releases [`crate::effects::Effect::Apply`] with the slot, the identity and
//! the payload, in slot order, at every node; the host's acknowledgement is
//! `Input::Applied { slot }` with no result, because the boundary is one-way
//! and the core never answers a proposal. Answering a proposer, and any
//! exactly-once policy, is the host's affair above the boundary.
//!
//! The system-slot ruling (§11): `applied` walks EVERY slot. A committed
//! system operation (the genesis [`crate::configuration::SystemOperation::Void`]/[`crate::configuration::SystemOperation::Init`] of §8.7.2) is core-internal
//! , it emits no [`crate::effects::Effect::Apply`] upcall and expects no acknowledgement, but it
//! advances `applied` the moment the contiguous committed prefix allows,
//! on every path that moves the committed or applied frontier. The host's `Input::Checkpointed { through }` is
//! accepted only when `through <= applied`; the published checkpoint
//! frontier is the sole reclamation authorization (§4, S1), applied to the
//! default journal by [`Replica::reclaim_journal`], lazy, whole slabs at
//! a time, never the tail, opportunistic on append.
//!
