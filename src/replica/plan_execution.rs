//! Plan execution: the leader side of the operator's reconfiguration plan
//! (`docs/uvr-protocols.md`, the solver chapter).
//!
//! The operator computes a plan once and submits it over the node's admin
//! ingress. The leader validates it against its current committed
//! configuration ([`crate::plan::Plan::validate_against`]) and answers with one verdict;
//! on acceptance the [`PlannedSequence`] machine is armed and steps through
//! the plan's batches while the cluster keeps running normally: one step per
//! era, each proposed through [`plan_step_proposal`], the fuse envelope
//! when the step packs at least two operations within the envelope budget,
//! the ordinary establishing [`crate::wire::Tag::Prepare`] otherwise
//! (`docs/uvr-fuse.md` §4). The forced-reincarnation machine steps its own
//! sequence the same way, one step per era on a tick, through
//! [`plan_reconfigure`] (§8 of the fuse doc).
//!
//! The machine is volatile like every attempt state: a leader crash discards
//! it, and the dumb-operator contract hands continuation to the operator, a
//! new leader executes nothing automatically; the plan is re-solicited against
//! the configuration that committed. A step the gates refuse is drift: a plan
//! computed to be legal cannot become illegal, so the refusal means the
//! cluster changed underneath the plan, and aborting is the correct behaviour
//! , the machine clears and [`crate::observe::Diagnostic::PlanAborted`] names it.
//!
