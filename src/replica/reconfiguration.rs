//! Reconfiguration: the stop-the-world path (§8.7.4) and the non-stop
//! overlap transition (§8.7.6–§8.7.7).
//!
//! A system operation is proposed through the ORDINARY pipeline like any
//! entry, one establishing operation at a time, and the era advances
//! exactly when the operation COMMITS (§8.7.1: an era is established by
//! the commit of its establishing operation, never by its acceptance).
//! The pivot is `None` on the stop-the-world path: the establishing
//! [`crate::wire::Tag::Prepare`] goes to every backup and the cluster enters the new era
//! through the next ordinary view change. A `Some` pivot names the
//! non-stop variant (§8.7.6–§8.7.7): the [`crate::wire::Tag::Prepare`] goes only to
//! `qII − {L}`, and when the operation commits through `qII` the leader
//! solicits PLANNED evidence from `qI − {L}`, never a fence, and, the
//! planned quorum complete, publishes its casting vote and its switch to
//! `v'` as ONE transition, then announces `StartView(v')` to every
//! member of config(e+1). The client stream is never interrupted:
//! ordinary era-(e+1) prepares continue through `qII` while the planned
//! exchange runs.
//!
//! The load-bearing rulings:
//!
//! * **Genesis is ordinary committed log history** (§8.7.1–§8.7.2): VOID
//!   at slot 1 in era 0, INIT at slot 2 in era 1, committed by
//!   construction at provision. The initial configuration is DERIVED from
//!   the entries, the same fold that runs at every later commit.
//! * **The pre-proposal gate is closed** (§8.7.2, §8.7.4, Q1): the fold's
//!   preconditions, then R2 across the era boundary, then R1 /
//!   self-intersection / fence-restart within the resulting era. A
//!   refusal is named, carries its witness, and the operation never
//!   enters the log. The pivot never substitutes for this gate.
//! * **The commit-time fold is the only place the era advances**
//!   (§8.7.1): every path that moves the commit frontier folds the system
//!   operations the advance newly covers and carries the folded table in
//!   the candidate ([`crate::replica::Replica::fold_committed`]). A fold refusal in
//!   COMMITTED history is a breach and faults; a refusal at the arriving
//!   entry's own slot is the peer's invalid operation and is dropped by
//!   name ([`crate::observe::Diagnostic::InvalidSystemOperation`]).
//! * **A primary crash mid-reconfiguration never half-installs an era**:
//!   an accepted-but-uncommitted system operation establishes nothing; if
//!   the view change carries it, the next commit cascade re-commits it
//!   and the era advances exactly there; if not, the operation is absent
//!   from history and the era never moved.
//! * **Planned evidence is transient and never a fence** (§8.7.7):
//!   [`crate::wire::Tag::PlannedViewChange`] recipients retain `current_view = v` and keep
//!   accepting valid era-e [`crate::wire::Tag::Prepare`]; their [`crate::EvidenceKind::Planned`]
//!   answers complete the planned quorum and are never counted toward a
//!   [`crate::quorum::Role::Fence`] or ordinary [`crate::quorum::Role::ViewChange`] quorum, the kinds are
//!   distinguishable on the wire and routed by kind.
