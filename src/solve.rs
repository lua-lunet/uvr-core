//! The reconfiguration solver: the legal path of alphabet operations between
//! two configurations, and the reduce-left fold that places the path into
//! slots, computing the era and the view each slot establishes.
//!
//! The alphabet is [`crate::configuration::SystemOperation`]: `Increment`,
//! `Decrement`, `Double`, `Halve`, `Join`, `Leave`, and the `Nominate` rider.
//! Legality is judged by [`Configuration::apply`], the proved fold engine
//! (rules §3–§4, R7–R15); the search never re-implements a rule. The search
//! is exhaustive over the mover set with a visited set over membership
//! shapes, so termination follows from the finite space (at most 16 members,
//! weights in {0, 1, 2}). The era advances at every establishing slot and the
//! `Nominate` rider tracks the running view, so the leader stays stable while
//! the cluster changes (`docs/uvr-protocols.md`, the NOMINATE chapter).
