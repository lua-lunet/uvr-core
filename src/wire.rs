//! Binary wire codec for protocol messages, and the optional serde and JSON bridges.
//!
//! Spec §11 (opaque client payloads), §13.1 (bounded view-change suffix) and decisions
//! W1, W3, W5, W4.
//!
//! The normative encoding is binary big-endian with a 20-byte header
//! `(tag: u32, era: u32, view: u32, slot: u64)` and no bit packing. Binary is normative
//! rather than merely available because the §13.1 suffix budget must be computable
//! exactly: a primary deciding how much history fits in a report needs the encoded size
//! of a candidate suffix to be a function of the suffix, not of the serializer's
//! whitespace or number formatting.
//!
//! There is no `MAX_DATAGRAM` here and there never will be (decision W5). Encoders
//! report the size they require and decoders report incomplete input; the host owns
//! every packetization decision, because only the host knows its MTU, its transport,
//! and whether it is willing to fragment.
//!
//! `serde` derives sit behind the `serde` feature so a host may impose its own
//! encoding, and the `maelstrom` feature adds a binary-to-JSON debug bridge. The bridge
//! exists so that the binary path is the one under test while the failure output is
//! readable; a JSON-native path would test the wrong codec.
//!
//! # What this module is, and what it is deliberately not
//!
//! This is the codec *substrate*: byte-level primitives, the [`Pack`] and [`Unpack`]
//! traits, the error taxonomy, the [`Tag`] discriminant table, and [`Header`]. It
//! defines no message body. A body defined here would have to be redefined once
//! [`Tag::Prepare`] has a log entry to carry and [`Tag::StartView`] has configuration evidence to
//! carry; each later message body owns its own encoding and adds its own round trip through the
//! traits below.
//!
//! # Zero allocation, both directions
//!
//! The primary API packs into a host-owned `&mut [u8]` and reads from a `&[u8]`. There
//! is no `Vec` in any signature and no allocation on either path. That is what lets one
//! implementation serve a C ABI caller with a stack buffer, a LuaJIT FFI buffer and a
//! WASM linear-memory slice, without a copy at the boundary or a second encoder to keep
//! in step.
//!
//! # Totality
//!
//! [`UnpackCursor`] returns `Ok` or `Err` on every input, adversarial included, in
//! release builds as well as debug. No `debug_assert` stands in for a check, there is no
//! `as` cast between integer widths, no `wrapping_*`, and no indexing that can panic:
//! every read goes through a bounds-checked accessor and a failed read becomes
//! [`UnpackError::Incomplete`]. A decoder that aborts the host process on a hostile
//! datagram is a denial-of-service vector, not a safety mechanism.
