//! The era planner: reduce-left batch evaluation
//! (`docs/uvr-protocols.md`, the reconfiguration-rules chapter §5).
//!
//! The leader never proposes an unsafe batch. Given a stream of operations it runs the
//! **reduce-left partitioner**: a fold carrying the tuple
//! `(taken ops, configuration so far, mass moved)`. For each incoming operation:
//!
//! 1. try the operation against the accumulated in-batch configuration;
//! 2. if the growing batch stays legal, R13–R15 and every per-op boundary at its
//!    point in the sequence, **take** it: extend the taken list and the
//!    configuration;
//! 3. if it would violate a rule, **pass only the prior list**: close the batch,
//!    the taken ops become one era's establishing operation, and retry the
//!    operation as the first op of the next batch.
//!
//! The legality oracle for every what-if is [`crate::configuration::Configuration::apply`] itself, on a
//! clone: everything is an immutable value and every operation is a pure function
//! `Configuration → Result<Configuration>`, so the planner and the fold cannot
//! disagree about what is legal, and the evaluation is thread-safe by construction,
//! with no lock and no mutation.
//!
//! The classic shapes fall out mechanically (§5): a ton of zero-weight joins stays in
//! one era because each moves no mass (R14); the reincarnation four split into the
//! canonical two; a scaling op forces the next op into a new batch (R13); and a batch
//! is never nested nor seeded with genesis (R15). A stream operation that is illegal
//! even alone refuses the plan outright, the partitioner invents no eras around a
//! boundary the fold refuses.
