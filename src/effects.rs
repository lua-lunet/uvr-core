//! Effects: what the core asks the host to do, as data.
//!
//! Spec §6 (functional core model), §7 (transition publication and durability),
//! §11 (application boundary). Decisions S2 (plan/publish/confirm, no host
//! callbacks), S3 (three-way stability), W1 (era as a transport-visible fact).
//!
//! The output half of `tick + message + state -> state + list(messages)`. An effect is an
//! inert description, send this datagram, persist this frontier, apply up to this slot,
//! never a closure, a channel handle, or a callback. The required property: **the effect
//! list is inspectable, replayable and assertable without executing it**, so a test can
//! diff the intended I/O of two runs and a host can reorder or batch effects under its
//! own policy (§13.6).
//!
//! Effects are returned, not performed. The core has no transport and no storage, so an
//! effect the host drops is a host decision with host consequences, and the core says so
//! rather than retrying behind the host's back.
//!
//! # Publication order is the safety argument
//!
//! §7's table assigns each [`Stability`] level a meaning *at effect release*:
//! an effect may only be released once the state supporting it has reached the
//! stability level the host declared. The core enforces that by construction:
//! in every mode except [`Stability::Volatile`] a published transition releases
//! exactly one effect, [`Effect::Persist`], and parks the rest until the
//! host's [`StabilityResult`] arrives as an ordinary serialized input (S2).
//! Calling a mutation "journalled" does not establish durability; the property
//! is that the barrier completed before the dependent effect became
//! observable.
