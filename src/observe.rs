//! Lockless observation of published progress from outside the transition interval.
//!
//! Spec §12 (concurrency contract for the C ABI) and decision B1. A diagnostic
//! thread, a metrics scraper, or a LuaJIT host holding the C ABI must read progress
//! without taking any lock the transition path takes: **a reader never blocks a
//! writer or another reader, and observation cannot delay the §12 serialized
//! transition interval**, a replica that stalls its transition to service a scrape
//! has converted observability into a liveness fault.
//!
//! The mechanism is a single-writer seqlock over a POD snapshot: even sequence
//! means stable, odd means write in progress, a torn read retries. Chosen over an
//! `Arc` swap because there is **no reclamation race to prove**, nothing is freed,
//! so no epoch, hazard pointer, or deferred drop whose soundness every later module
//! would have to re-establish. The cost is reader spin under a write storm; writes
//! are bounded by the transition rate. This module and the future `ffi` module are
//! the only two places `unsafe` is permitted. Observation is read-only (§15).

// Scoped `unsafe` exception (decision B1). The proof obligations are written at
// each use: the payload accesses, the `Send`/`Sync` impls, and the writer claim.
