//! Sans-I/O Viewstamped Replication Revisited (VRR-2012).
//!
//! `uvrr-core` is a library with a C ABI, not a framework. It never tells the host what
//! to do. The whole of it is one total function,
//!
//! ```text
//! tick + message + state -> state + list(messages)
//! ```
//!
//! and nothing in this crate reads a clock, opens a socket, touches a file, or spawns a
//! thread. The host owns time, transport, storage, packetization, threading and naming.
//! `docs/architecture.md` records what is closed for modification, what is open for
//! extension, and the rulings each module below is judged against. The normative
//! specification is `docs/uvr-durability-model.md`, and every
//! section reference in this crate is to that document.
//!
//! # The modules
//!
//! `ids` (identity newtypes, the durable pair, [`crate::ids::Ballot`], the [`crate::ids::Fault`]
//! taxonomy), `wire` (the normative binary codec), `configuration` (era, membership,
//! weights, the reconfiguration fold), `journal` (the four logical journal
//! capabilities), `progress` (the [`crate::progress::Progress`] record), `observe` (seqlock observation),
//! `invariant` (the closed transition-legality checker), `quorum` (the strategy and the
//! closed intersection gate), `message` (the protocol bodies), `effects` (the host
//! effect vocabulary), `backoff` (the recommended randomized-timeout schedule, as
//! pure arithmetic for the host), `lifecycle` (the boot gate and the typestate
//! marker driver) and `replica` (the plan/publish/confirm pipeline and the
//! lifecycle) carry contract tests. `replica` is split into `normal` (§4
//! [`crate::wire::Tag::Prepare`]/[`crate::wire::Tag::PrepareOk`]/[`crate::wire::Tag::Commit`]), `view_change` (§9),
//! `transfer` (state transfer, §13.1 step 5), `reincarnation` (§10, §6.1) and
//! `reconfiguration` (§8.7.1–§8.7.8).

// `deny`, not `forbid`: `observe` publishes a POD snapshot through a seqlock and the
// future `ffi` module crosses the C ABI. Each will carry one scoped
// `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` with a doc comment naming the invariant that makes it sound
// (decision B1). `forbid` would make those exceptions unexpressible and push the
// unsafety into a separate crate, where it is harder to audit rather than easier.
#![deny(unsafe_code)]
// Every public item states its intent and the property it must hold, so the intent
// outlives the code that currently implements it.
#![deny(missing_docs)]

// The README's Rust code blocks are doctests: `cargo test --doc` compiles and
// runs them. `#[cfg(doctest)]` keeps this module out of every non-doctest build
// (including normal `cargo test`), and the inner `#![doc = include_str!]` makes
// rustdoc extract the fenced blocks as tests without bloating the crate's
// published API docs. This is the only place README code is exercised, so the
// README stays illustrative and a single source of truth stays compiling.
#[cfg(doctest)]

    #![doc = include_str!("../README.md")]
