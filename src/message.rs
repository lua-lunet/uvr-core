//! The message vocabulary: [`crate::wire::Header`] plus the protocol bodies.
//!
//! Spec §4 (state transfer), §6 (normal operation), §9 (view change), §10
//! (recovery), §11.1 (the application boundary), §13.3 (piggybacked commit
//! frontier), and decisions W1 (era in every header), W3 (normative exact
//! lengths), W4 (fixed-width big-endian), S4 (the tick serves as the classic
//! recovery nonce).
//!
//! A [`Message`] is the 20-byte [`crate::wire::Header`] followed by a one-byte body
//! discriminant and the body fields. The kind travels twice, once as the
//! header's `u32` [`crate::wire::Tag`], once as the body's `u8` discriminant, and the two
//! must agree: a disagreement is malformed, never guessed at, because the wire
//! cannot say which field lied. Body discriminants mirror the [`crate::wire::Tag`] numbering
//! exactly, and `0` is reserved for the same reason it is reserved in the
//! wire [`crate::wire::Tag`]: an all-zero buffer is not a message.
//!
//! The header slot field is framed for regularity, not because every message
//! names a position. What a tag's header slot may legally carry is
//! [`crate::invariant::header_slot_role`]'s table, and this module stays
//! agnostic about it exactly as [`crate::wire`] does: the codec encodes the
//! fields, the legality checker rules on them.
