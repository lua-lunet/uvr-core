# uVRR citation graph

This page is a read-only view of the graph data in `data.js`. When served from
the repository root, it loads `paper/papers/references.bib` and
`study/consensus-paxos-vrr.json` on opening. The BibTeX file is
Zotero's automatic export of the paper collection; the JSON file preserves the
wider consensus reading collection for the graph.
Choose other files using **Read Zotero collection exports**. The filename is
used as the collection label in the dropdown. The page reads exported records
in the browser and never edits or uploads the selected files.
It does not connect to Zotero's database or read Zotero notes, attachments, or
fields that Better BibTeX did not export. Use **Find a loaded reference** to
search citation keys, titles, authors, and abstracts; click a result to read
its exported abstract in the details panel. Each loaded reference also has a
clickable graph node. Existing nodes with a matching citation key display the
Zotero title, authors, abstract, and link in the details panel; other loaded
references appear as grey Zotero nodes without invented citation edges.
The details panel opens an exported URL when present, a DOI or arXiv landing
page when identifiable, or a clearly labelled title search when the record has
no source link.

After loading the files, teal outlines mark graph nodes whose explicit
Better BibTeX key appears in the selected export. Switch exports with the
collection dropdown; **Show only graph works in the selected collection**
hides unmatched nodes and edges. The `uvrrpaper` node stays as context so its
outgoing references remain visible. The checkbox starts unchecked so the
full graph remains available.

## Abstract refresh

Zotero is the source of truth for the loaded abstracts and links. Better BibTeX
auto-exports that data to `references.bib`, including URL fields. When an export
has a gap, prefer the primary paper's published abstract. For a self-published
post, derive a short abstract from the front-page snippet; if no snippet exists,
take a first-sentence summary from the opening text and keep it descriptive
rather than evaluative. Keep the derived text in Zotero's Abstract field and let
the export refresh, rather than editing abstracts inside the graph. The current
`references.bib` has an abstract for every exported record.

The `Consensus — Paxos & VRR` reading collection is represented in the graph
by `study/consensus-paxos-vrr.json`. It has an abstract for every
record. Refresh the JSON from a complete Zotero export of that collection;
check the item count before replacing the snapshot, because Zotero can export
only a filtered view. The graph reads the refreshed JSON on page reload.

The key crosswalk is explicit in `data.js`. If a citekey changes in Zotero,
update that mapping to match the next export. The chart does not infer identity
from titles or abstracts and does not treat an unkeyed graph node as a match.
The two built-in sources are reread on page reload. Files chosen through the
picker are a one-time browser read: reselect them after Better BibTeX refreshes
them. This is an export-based sync, not a live Zotero connection. Give each
additional collection export a distinct filename so it is easy to identify in
the dropdown.

Edges are directed from source to target; edge labels describe the recorded
citation or relationship. The bibliography filter checks node membership in
the selected bibliography source. It does not parse the LaTeX source to decide
whether an entry is actually cited in the paper body.

## Keeping Zotero projects separate

Use one Zotero library with project collections and topic tags. A reference
can belong to more than one collection without creating duplicate items.
For the uVRR paper, keep its Better BibTeX auto-export targeted at the current
paper bibliography and preserve that path because the TeX source uses it.
For the software-security research, use a separate collection and a distinct
export file outside this paper's bibliography path. Load both sources in the
graph and select a collection there. Do not point the paper's TeX command at a
combined library export when you want a paper-specific bibliography.

For your WordPress posts, save the post as a Web Page item through the Zotero
Connector and keep the snapshot attachment if you want a local captured copy.
Snapshots preserve the page as it looked when saved; they do not track later
edits. Save a new snapshot/version when a post changes materially. Zotero's
stored-file syncing is separate from metadata syncing, so confirm attachment
file sync is enabled if you need snapshots on other devices. Keep private
drafts or notes out of any shared group or published graph.
