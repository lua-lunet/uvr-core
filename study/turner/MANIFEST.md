# Turner paper reference artifacts — manifest

Source: David C. Turner, "Unbounded Pipelining in Dynamically Reconfigurable Paxos
Clusters," revision 1A9DBA37, 14 August 2017 —
https://tessanddave.com/paxos-reconf-latest.pdf (10 pages, US Letter, 612×792 pt).

## Reference papers of record

Two public copies of the Viewstamped Replication lineage are banked here as the
register references for the retelling; their introductions are the register the
rewritten paper matches.

- `vsr-1988-oki-liskov.pdf` — B. M. Oki and B. H. Liskov, "Viewstamped
  Replication: A New Primary Copy Method to Support Highly-Available Distributed
  Systems," Proc. ACM PODC 1988, pp. 8–17 (10 pages). Public copy fetched from
  https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15712/papers/oki88.pdf. sha256
  `ebaf3c9159a06203da7fadbd88b0ef8b5435a2bac7cba69a19617a5f68b66f92`.
  The PDF is a scanned copy with an OCR text layer; the page text carries
  scanning artifacts ("netwolrk", "faiistop") that do not affect the figures or
  the statements used as register references.
- `vrr-2012-liskov-cowling.pdf` — B. Liskov and J. Cowling, "Viewstamped
  Replication Revisited," MIT-CSAIL-TR-2012-021, 23 July 2012 (16 pages).
  Public copy fetched from
  https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/71763/MIT-CSAIL-TR-2012-021.pdf
  (the DSpace record lists the MD5 `19cfab7a34e323c00102c7fd2f7289cb` for the
  same bitstream). sha256
  `a4be688ed2d5ebb02511cde31ef43001cc7668681af9393bab69b5e3397895b6`.
  Authorship note: every public copy of this technical report (MIT DSpace, the
  PMG copy, and university mirrors) names Barbara Liskov and James Cowling as
  the authors; no four-author edition is publicly verifiable, and the paper's
  bibliography cites the two-author form.

## Acquisition and pinning

- `paxos-reconf-latest.pdf` — sha256
  `3f5ffd4ecdf89f4dd8887a74b9f91d52914fcbe27183857cf68c6ff7cfd7f8ff`.
  The revision marker `1A9DBA37` appears in the running header of all 10 pages
  (`pdftotext` page stream), so the exact revision is pinned.
- Fetched over plain HTTP: the host's TLS certificate does not cover the requested
  hostname (it is served as `serval.mythic-beasts.com` only, on both `tessanddave.com`
  and `www.tessanddave.com`), so HTTPS transport could not be name-verified. Content
  integrity rests on the revision marker and the sha256 above.

## Text extraction

- `text.txt` — sha256
  `b43ba62be656af15228677b273fd09eb119e85af485f1f0fe83a26c62d73cedb`.
  Produced with `pdftotext -layout` (poppler). This is the faithful verbatim text.
- Cross-check: pages 1, 3, 6 and 8 rendered at 150 dpi (`pdftoppm`) and re-read with
  `tesseract --psm 1`. Agreements: the revision marker reads identically on every
  sampled page; figure captions and distinctive prose phrases match verbatim.
  Disagreements, all of the expected OCR-of-math class, none affecting `text.txt`:
  - OCR reads the prime glyph ′ as an ASCII apostrophe, ℓ as ¢ or £, ∈ as €, and the
    "plc" ligature as "ple" in the small footer text; `pdftotext` preserves these.
  - `pdftotext` quirks of this dvips-produced PDF (known, systematic): the
    quorum-intersection symbol ⌢ (U+2322), ≺, ≻, ℓ, ⊆ and set symbols extract
    correctly, but `≠` extracts as the pair `6=`, the non-strict ballot-ordering
    relation in Lemmas 6–7 extracts as a single control byte 0x16 (the PDF uses a
    Type 3 glyph without a Unicode mapping; the relation is the reflexive closure of
    ≺), and subscripts are flattened (e.g. `QIe(b)` for Q^I_{e(b)}).

## Summary

- `summary.md` — sha256
  `968496c3a509d84a43f3305517a871d7a34ffc3167399156f7872f8948065da4`.
  Section-by-section claims, the full lemma/theorem list, and the figure contents,
  curated to timeless prose. Drafted with Mistral `mistral-large-latest` over four
  text chunks plus one consolidation round, then checked line-by-line against
  `text.txt` and corrected to the paper's own notation (⌢, ≺, ≻, era subscripts).

## Figures

Five figures, extracted as full-page vector SVGs with `pdftocairo -svg` (one per
figure's page) and cropped by rewriting the root `width`/`height`/`viewBox` to the
figure region (top-left origin, points; the page content itself is unmodified vector).
Caption text is excluded from the crops; captions are listed here.

| Figure | Page | Caption (excluded from crop) | Crop box (x, y, w, h) |
|--------|------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | 3 | Fig. 1. Invariants preserved by the Synod algorithm | 42, 71, 528, 123 |
| 2 | 5 | Fig. 2. Invariants preserved by the Paxos algorithm | 42, 71, 528, 166 |
| 3 | 6 | Fig. 3. Message flow during a reconfiguration. | 308, 48, 258, 365 |
| 4 | 7 | Fig. 4. Message flow for Dynamic Paxos with α = 2. | 308, 48, 258, 365 |
| 5 | 8 | Fig. 5. Message flow for Stoppable Paxos. | 44, 48, 260, 365 |

PNG renders (`fig-<n>.png`): headless Google Chrome (`--headless=new
--force-device-scale-factor=4 --window-size=<intrinsic px> --hide-scrollbars
--default-background-color=FFFFFFFF`, screenshot of the SVG file), i.e. 96 dpi natural
size at 4× device scale ≈ 5.33 px/pt. All PNGs are well under 2 MB. Render fidelity
was verified by matching ink-density band profiles against `pdftoppm` renders of the
same page regions.

`fig-<n>.description.md`: standalone descriptions produced with Mistral
`mistral-medium-latest` vision (chat completions, image passed as a base64 `data:`
URI `image_url`), prompted to describe only what is visible — nodes, lifelines,
arrows with direction and endpoints, regions/bands, verbatim labels, ordering — with
no source context. These are the reference set for comparison against identically
produced descriptions of original redrawings. Known vision quirks to expect on both
sides of any comparison: the quorum-intersection symbol ⌢ is misread as ⊂ or →, and
subscripts are transcribed informally.

## Original redrawn figures — double-blind verdicts

The paper's five figures are original TikZ redrawings (VRR vocabulary, shaded
era bands, event dots; Turner's are plain-line diagrams with dashed era rules),
verified per the reference protocol: the published page is cropped to the figure
region (caption excluded, 300 dpi via pdftoppm), the PNG is sent to Mistral
vision (`mistral-medium-latest`, the same prompt that produced the reference
`fig-<n>.description.md` bank), and the returned standalone description is
compared against the reference description. A figure passes when the two
descriptions agree on the semantic content: nodes, arrows with direction and
endpoints, phases, and ordering. No eyes-on-originals at any point.

Verdicts (final reads, 300 dpi crops of the published PDF):

| Redrawn figure | Reference | Semantic agreement | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invariants S1–S6 (framed list) | fig-1.description.md | framed list of formal statements labeled S1–S6 over proposed/chosen/promised/accepted, quorums, quantifiers | PASS |
| Invariants P1–P7 (framed list) | fig-2.description.md | framed list P1–P7: configuration condition, suffix/point promise era bounds, i_max, value rule, choice bounds | PASS |
| Fully concurrent reconfiguration flow | fig-3.description.md | three lifelines a1/ℓ/a2; prepare(b)→ℓ in era e, prepare(b′)→ℓ in era e+1; fourteen ℓ→a2 proposals i..i+13 in order, i..i+11 on b and i+12/i+13 on b′; era e holds i..i+5, era e+1 holds i+6..i+13 | PASS |
| Bounded-pipeline regime (α=2) | fig-4.description.md | three lifelines; both prepares a1→ℓ in era e; six proposals i..i+5 on b in era e, two proposals i+6/i+7 on b′ in era e+1 | PASS |
| Stop-and-reconfigure regime | fig-5.description.md | three lifelines; prepare(b)→ℓ in era e, prepare(b′)→ℓ in era e+1; four ℓ→a2 proposals i, i+3, i+1, i+2 in era e (the out-of-order stop), three i+4/i+5/i+6 on b′ in era e+1 | PASS |

Known vision quirks, documented above and expected on both sides of every
comparison: the quorum-intersection symbol ⌢ is misread (∉/⊨ here; ⊂/→ in the
reference reads), era labels transcribe informally ("e+1" as "e+" or "e + 1"),
and single reads can garble one endpoint or band before iteration; the passing
reads are the final reads of the published PDF. Iteration history: the framed
lists passed on the first read; the lifeline figures needed scale and
band-contrast iteration — the unbounded flow only read its era membership
correctly once redrawn at a column footprint comparable to Turner's original.
