# agent366 — harvested reference corpus

Every external work cited from `docs/*` or `paper/*`, pulled down on 2026-09-28,
plus Raft (user instruction: "i have not mentioned RAFT … yet go get it").
PDFs in `papers/`; extracted text in `md/`. Extraction: `pdftotext` default
mode (reading order; two-column layouts come out de-columnised) for
born-digital PDFs, `pdftoppm` + `tesseract` (300 dpi, eng) for scans.
`paper.pdf` has both (`paper.md` = pdftotext, `paper.ocr.md` = tesseract).

## Line-numbered extractions

Every rendered paper has its `.txt` beside its PDF in `papers/` — one
name-sorted folder holds pdf, locator text and (in the reading folder) the
abstract card together, and a gap is visible at a glance. Turner's own
paper, the two Liskov PDFs and EPaxos were moved in here for exactly that
reason; the Zotero bib snapshot stays in `../literature/turner/`.

Each `.txt` carries the paper's text in single-column reading order with a
right-aligned line number on every body line, so any passage is quotable
verbatim with a locator: a right-column run is one contiguous stretch of
ascending numbers, which the interleaved `-layout` extraction cannot give.
Each file carries a YAML header with the Zotero bib metadata, the source PDF
path and sha256, the page count and the tool version, plus `=== PAGE n ===`
page markers.

Generated by `tools/linear_corpus.py` through `tools/pdftolines.py`
(poppler's `pdftohtml -xml` geometry, interior-gutter column detection), in
the order the paper cites each work, then the rest of the corpus
alphabetically. Reruns are byte-identical: the extraction date is a
parameter, not the clock. `papers/00-linear-manifest.md` records every
result; the four papers not rendered there (the two EWD manuscripts and
Hoare 1969 are scans without a text layer, Lampson 1996 makes poppler emit
malformed XML) name their OCR'd or transcribed markdown under `md/` as the
reading surface, and reach the reading folder as `<key>-text.md`.

The `.txt` files are a locator and a quoting surface, not a reading copy:
quote the `.txt` for the line number and the paper for authority.

The four papers without a geometry render each gained a `*.mistral-ocr.md`
surface in `md/` (mistral-ocr-latest over the PDF, provenance and source
sha256 in a header comment): the two EWD manuscripts are page images in a
Distiller wrapper with a placeholder text stub, Hoare 1969 is a pure
Photoshop scan, and Lampson 1996 has a clean text layer that poppler's
`-xml` path alone chokes on (it emits misnested `<b>/<i>` markup for this
Distiller 2.1 file, which an XML parser must reject). These OCR surfaces
are unverified against the rendered pages and are ticketed for a vision
pass before they are quoted.
