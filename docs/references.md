# UVR references

The external works the documents and the code cite, in one place, under
stable short identifiers. A citation of the form `[VR-2012]` in a document
or a doc comment names an entry of this file, and the code's reference gate
(`tests/doc_reference_contract.rs`) resolves every citation identifier
against the headings here. A section number following an identifier, as in
"`[VR-2012]` §4.3", names a section of the cited work itself; the gate does
not validate those, the works are not ours to restructure. This file is a
living document: a new citation adds an entry, and an entry is never
renumbered, so a citation once written stays true.
