# UVR Fuse: one reconfiguration schedule, one datagram, one round trip

Fuse is a wire envelope that packs the per-slot Phase2 (`Prepare`) messages of one
reconfiguration schedule into a single datagram. It is not a new protocol semantic:
the packed ops are one slab of consecutive slots, every packed slot carries its own
ballot, and per-op safety is the ordinary accept path; only the wire shape changes.
The slab's ballots advance per slot: the fold stamps each packed slot with the era
the fold of the preceding slots established, so the slab spans one era per
establishing operation it packs, and the era the header carries disciplines the
first payload alone. Accepting a Phase2 at a slot is a promise to that slot's ballot even
when the corresponding Phase1 was lost, so an acceptor that folds a slab ends
promised at the slab's tail ballot, never at the head ballot it started from. This
document states what Fuse IS; the command alphabet and its boundaries are
`docs/uvr-protocols.md` (the reconfiguration-rules chapter), and the durability
framing is `docs/uvr-durability-model.md` §13.8.

## 1. The envelope

A `Fuse` is one protocol message with the standard 20-byte header. The header
carries the head ballot of the slab once:

| Field | Role |
|---|---|
| `view`, `era` | `head_ballot`: the ballot of the first packed slot |
| `slot` | `first_slot`: the slot of the first packed op; each subsequent op occupies `first_slot + i` |
| body | `count`, then `count × SystemOperation`, in batch order |

`head_ballot` is the ballot of slot `first_slot` and of no other packed slot: the
header's era authorises the head slot's op, and the header's guards discipline the
head slot alone. Every later packed slot is authorised by the era the fold of the
preceding slots established: the era advances once per establishing slot, so slot
`first_slot + i` carries the era `era(head_ballot) + j`, where `j` counts the
establishing operations among the first `i` packed ops. A `Nominate` rider
establishes no era of its own: it shares the era of the slot it rides, so the
rider's slot carries its carrier's era and the rider's commit-time bump enters the
era the carrier's fold established (the NOMINATE chapter of
`docs/uvr-protocols.md`). The slab's `tail_ballot` is the ballot of its final
packed slot, `first_slot + count - 1`, and the header does not carry it: the tail
ballot is computed by the reconfiguration solver as it folds the schedule slot by
slot, one ballot per packed slot, and the acceptor's fold arrives at those ballots
in the same order as it folds the slab. `tail_ballot` strictly exceeds
`head_ballot` exactly when the slab spans an era boundary — when it packs more
than one establishing operation; a slab whose packed ops share one era (one
establishing op and the riders it carries) is an in-era slab and lands
`tail_ballot == head_ballot`. The slab's slots are
`[first_slot, first_slot + count)`.

The body discriminant and pack/unpack live beside the membership command codec
(`src/configuration.rs`); the tag tables carry the mapping. No range encodings:
the count names the things and the things follow, one slot at a time.

## 2. The atomic batch property

A Fuse envelope is a single datagram carrying a cache-line-scale payload (a full
cluster reconfiguration is at most seven operations). It travels under the
transport's checksum. Loss or interruption *inside* a batch is impossible: the
envelope arrives whole or not at all.

Therefore the first operation in the batch decides the whole batch. Membership,
view, era, and slot discipline are checked on `first_slot` at `head_ballot`; if the
first op is acceptable, every following op is acceptable at its own slot and its own
ballot, the ballot the solver computed for that slot as it folded the schedule. The
induction's invariant is the ordinary accept path's, evaluated per slot against the
in-memory configuration the fold of the preceding payloads established: the next
slot is consecutive, the command is legal in the accumulated configuration, the
promise still permits the slot's ballot, and the slot's era — the era the preceding
payloads' fold established — permits the proposal. A promise to a slot's ballot is
a promise to every future accept at that ballot, and the slab's promise ends at
`tail_ballot` (§3). "First accepts ⇒ all accept" is a finite induction over at most
`FUSE_MAX_OPS` operations, not a proof over interruption points mid-sequence.
Majority and quorum accounting are computed on the first op in the batch, and each
packed slot's eligibility is judged at that slot's own ballot.

Consequences:

- No inductive proof over interruptions during cluster reconfiguration is owed.
  The only interruption point in the state space is at the envelope boundary.
- Loss and partition testing acts at envelope granularity: one atomic action per
  reconfiguration batch.

## 3. The acceptor transition

On receiving a `Fuse` from the primary:

1. Validate the header once, exactly as `plan_prepare` validates a `Prepare`:
   sender is primary of the message's view, view discipline, era discipline of
   the first op, and the boot-adoption carve-outs. The header's ballot is
   `head_ballot`, so the header's guards discipline the head slot and no other
   packed slot.
2. If the header refuses, the whole envelope is dropped and one named
   diagnostic is recorded. Nothing is partially applied; there is no partial
   acceptance and no wire nack.
3. If the header passes, explode the batch logically: for each `i`, slot
   `first_slot + i` must equal the local accept frontier's next slot, and the
   op folds through the ordinary system-op perimeter (the same `Configuration`
   refusals R1–R15 that an individual `Prepare` would meet) at that slot's own
   ballot, the ballot the solver computed for it. Each op is judged in-era at
   its point in the sequence — a `Nominate` rider folds to the identical
   configuration, never a solitary refusal, because the rider is judged inside
   the slab's fold, never alone — and the journal stamps each packed slot with
   the era the fold of the preceding slots established (§1), the rider's slot
   sharing its carrier's era. The accept frontier advances per op and the
   journal records the batch as one contiguous accept.
4. Any op refusing mid-batch is unrepresentable when the header passed and the
   schedule is legal: the planner already certified the sequence, and slots are
   consecutive. If an implementation-level refusal nevertheless occurs, the
   whole envelope is dropped with a `FuseRefusal` diagnostic, never a partial
   fold.
5. All ops accepted: reply `FuseOk`, `count`, then one accepted slot per op in
   batch order. No ranges.

**The promise-to-tail obligation.** A Phase2 accepted at a slot is a promise to
that slot's ballot, whether or not the corresponding Phase1 ever reached this
acceptor: the debt is incurred by the accept, and a lost Phase1 does not withdraw
it. An acceptor that has folded the slab has accepted at `head_ballot`, at the
ballots between, and at `tail_ballot`, so it owes `tail_ballot` and accepts
nothing below it from then on. The promise is the slab's last ballot and never the
head ballot the envelope started from: a promise at the head would leave every
later packed slot's accept unpromised. The obligation is discharged as per-slot
facts: the journal stamps each packed slot with the ballot's era the slot's accept
promised, and the node's serving view lands at the tail's era when the slab
commits — the nomination rider's bump carries it there in the same advance — or
paces the slab's eras one established era at a time (§4 step 4).

**The slab assert.** The acceptor asserts the slab before it folds it, and the
assert is hard: `tail_ballot >= head_ballot && head_ballot >= current_promise`,
where `current_promise` is the acceptor's standing promise, the greatest ballot it
has entered, and the inequality is strict exactly when the slab spans an era
boundary (§1: more than one establishing operation). A slab whose ballots
retreat is not a schedule the solver computed slot by slot — the fold's per-slot
ballots never retreat, and an in-era slab lawfully lands
`tail_ballot == head_ballot` — and a slab whose head ballot sits below the
standing promise would break that promise at its first accept. Neither is a
judgement call and neither is a wire refusal: the check is an assert, and an
acceptor that cannot meet it does not fold the slab.

**The slab install.** The install covers `[first_slot, first_slot + count)`: the
journal entries, the accept frontier, and the promise advance together across the
range, one packed slot per step as the loop names them, the promise ending at
`tail_ballot`.

## 4. The leader transition

On proposing an establishing batch of at least two operations (a single-op
batch travels as an ordinary `Prepare` and needs no envelope):

1. Build one `Fuse` per recipient backup: header `first_slot` = the next
   unsent slot, body = the batch's operations in plan order, one op per
   consecutive slot. The solver has folded the schedule slot by slot, so each
   packed slot carries its own ballot and the header carries the first of them,
   `head_ballot`; the final packed slot's ballot is `tail_ballot`. The batch's
   legality is gated whole before the envelope is built: the same
   reconfiguration gates an ordinary establishing `Prepare` passes, run on the
   batch the envelope packs.
2. Register one proposal record per packed slot; the leader's own vote is
   implicit, as in the ordinary path.
3. One `FuseOk` is ONE atomic vote (§2): the leader counts the sender
   once, cumulatively onto every outstanding slot the header slot covers:
   the header slot is the slab's last slot as the acceptor stamps it, so
   the vouch spans the slab whole. Majority is computed on the first
   message in batch; the one reply set is the evidence at every packed
   slot, each judged at that slot's own ballot. The `acks` body is
   the acceptor's wire evidence and is not examined for counting.
4. When every packed slot holds a quorum, the commit cascade commits the
   batch whole: the packed schedule's maximal run of consecutive system
   entries segments into one era per establishing slot, the per-slot era
   stamps of §1 marking the boundaries — a maximal run of entries sharing
   one era is one era's establishing fold, the establishing op and the
   riders it carries — and the fold establishes the slab's eras in slot
   order (§8.7.1). The fold advances only as far as the serving view can
   carry: a run establishes at most one era past the view's era, except
   that a run whose rider's nomination matches the serving view redeems
   its own advance, the bump landing the view at the run's era in the
   same advance, so the solver's ridered schedules commit the whole slab
   in one advance and the leader stays stable across the slab's eras.
   What the view cannot carry defers: the fold stops before the run, the
   committed frontier stops at the last folded slot, and the deferred
   tail commits as the view paces the slab's eras, one ordinary view
   change into each established era — the same machine the unpaced
   envelope elides (§6). The commit emission is PER ERA: one
   `CommitBatch` per establishing run committed, `count`, then one
   committed frontier per slot of that run, in batch order. No ranges.
   The `CommitBatch` is a broadcast fired the instant the run's quorum
   completes, never a round trip; backups advance their frontiers and
   fold the era through the ordinary commit announcement that travels
   with it. A fast-forward single-commit collapsing the batch is future
   work.
5. Fallback: if the batch exceeds `FUSE_MAX_OPS` or the builder's envelope
   budget, the leader emits the ordinary per-op `Prepare`s instead. The
   codec has no size constant (W5); the builder's cap is a build-site
   policy, and both paths are the same sequence of logical accepts, so
   safety is identical.
6. Leadership loss while awaiting the majority clears the pending fuse slots
   with the epoch, exactly as ordinary pending proposals die at view-change
   install. No new failure mode.

## 5. What Fuse does not do

- Client operations never fuse. The envelope carries reconfiguration operations
  only; client traffic continues at higher slots during the fuse round with no
  head-of-line blocking. No interleaving of client and admin commands is
  required: the leader chooses the whole admin schedule at once.
- Fuse slots are ordinary journal slots. No new persistence obligation, no new
  flush, and no flush elision: the durability profile in force applies
  unchanged.
- Fuse introduces no new quorum family, no new configuration state, and no new
  era rule. The slab's per-slot eras are the ordinary fold's per-operation
  establishment discharged in slot order — an era is still established by the
  commit of its establishing operation, never by an acceptance (§8.7.1) — so
  the consecutive-era intersection obligations hold per boundary, each a unit
  change. It is message packing.

## 6. The single round trip

The solver precomputes the whole schedule before anything is emitted, and the
schedule is small, a full cluster reconfiguration is at most seven
operations, well inside a single MTU, so the schedule travels as one
envelope per recipient: leader to each backup, one `FuseOk` back, one
`CommitBatch` out. That is one round trip for the schedule, the standard
batching optimisation: the per-datagram transport and authenticated-encryption
overheads are paid once across the packed operations, not once per operation.
The cross-DC maximum RTT of 3.3 ms measured in
`docs/uvr-experiment-design.md` therefore bounds the whole swap, not each
era of it; the per-op `Prepare` round trips no longer multiply it.

The round trip is one collection of replies, not one per op, because the
atomic batch property (§2) makes each recipient's processing
all-or-nothing: the node validates the header, takes its processing lock,
and folds the payloads in batch order entirely in memory, no disk flush
between payloads, no other datagram read mid-batch, so it either records
every accept or none. The set of nodes acknowledging the first packed op is
therefore exactly the set acknowledging every packed op: a quorum for the
first is a quorum for all, and the leader counts the replies once. Each
payload's guards, slot consecutiveness, command legality, era discipline,
and ballot are evaluated against the in-memory configuration the fold of the
preceding payloads established, exactly as though the payloads had arrived as
separate datagrams with nothing between them; the header's checks discipline
the head slot alone, and the per-payload state, ballot included, is the thing
that advances.

Emitting one envelope per establishing batch, one round trip per batch, the
batch's eras committing in one advance under the nomination the batch rides,
the ordinary view change into each established era between the paced
emissions, is the same machine unpaced, and is equally valid: packing changes
the wire, not the machine. The engine emits per batch today; whole-schedule
packing elides only the network between the steps the paced emission already
runs back to back.

## 7. Test obligations

- The leader of an armed schedule emits exactly one `Fuse` per backup; the
  body carries the schedule's operations in order with the correct
  `first_slot`.
- A stale-view acceptor refuses the whole envelope: zero slots accepted, one
  diagnostic, no partial fold.
- A valid acceptor accepts all slots, records one contiguous journal accept
  with the per-slot era stamps of §1, replies one `FuseOk`, and ends owing
  the slab's `tail_ballot`, the per-slot promises discharged in the journal's
  stamps.
- On quorum, every packed slot commits in order; one `CommitBatch` is
  broadcast per establishing run; the era table advances through the whole
  schedule, one era per establishing slot, the serving view landing at the
  slab's final era on the rider's bump; subsequent client proposals land
  above the fused range.
- The oversized schedule falls back to ordinary `Prepare`s.
- The existing reconfiguration, reincarnation, and cold-start corpora pass
  unmodified: Fuse changes the wire, not the machine.

## 8. Fuse is transport

The ruling this document closes on: Fuse is a wire format and a transport-layer
optimisation, nothing more. The algorithm never knows it is talking to a
batch: the promise to the tail ballot is the ordinary Phase2 promise at each
of the slab's slots, discharged at the last of them.

**The wire shape.** One datagram: the 20-byte header carrying the head
ballot once and `first_slot`, then the body, `count`, then `count ×
SystemOperation`, in batch order. The reply is `count` + the accepted slots;
the commit emission is `count` + one committed frontier per slot. No range
encodings anywhere on the fuse surface: the count names the things and the
things follow, one element at a time.

**The one-unpack explode.** The acceptor unpacks the envelope once at the
codec boundary and never re-encodes. The explode is a struct copy: each
packed op takes the ballot the solver computed for its own slot, so the
data off the wire is exactly what sending N individual `Prepare`s would
have produced, minus the N datagrams. No per-message `Message` value is
constructed and no per-message codec work runs; the reply is the single
`FuseOk` the whole slab earns.

**The explicit algorithm loop.** The acceptor's only fuse-aware site is the
explode loop itself: for each `i`, the op at `first_slot + i`, the explicit
per-element step, one `Slot::next()` per element, folds through the
ordinary system-op perimeter, the same guards per op, the same journal
accept batch, the frontier and the promise advancing per op, the promise
ending at `tail_ballot`. There is no fuse-specific branch inside the per-slot
logic beyond the loop: every op is judged exactly as an individually-arrived
`Prepare` at its own slot and its own ballot would be. The leader side is
symmetric: the builder packs the schedule's ops with the head ballot in the
header and each op's own ballot on its slot, transport only, and the proposal
bookkeeping is what N individual proposals would register, one record and one
journal entry per packed slot.

**The no-ranged-actions rule.** No range arithmetic and no span computation
exists anywhere on the fuse surface: no range types, no span arithmetic, no
chunking or windowing over fused slots. Every slot a fuse datagram touches is
named explicitly, either by the envelope header's `first_slot` plus the
explode loop's per-element step or by an element of the body's list.

**The equivalence claim.** A fused slab of N ops produces the same accepts,
journal entries — the same slot, the same era stamp, the same value at every
packed slot — acks, and commits as the same N ops arriving as N individual
`Prepare`s at consecutive slots, and the same promise at the end of it; only
the datagram count differs. The wire carries the head ballot once where N
messages would carry each slot's ballot, and the acceptor's explode loop
reconstructs the identical per-slot sequence, the per-slot eras included:
payload `i + 1`'s era guard is judged in the era payload `i`'s fold
established, exactly as though the payloads had arrived as separate datagrams
with nothing between them.

**The proposal vehicles.** The fuse path's proposal vehicle is the plan-execution
machine (§4): an accepted plan steps one batch per step, each proposed through
the shared step-proposal router that emits the envelope when the batch packs
at least two operations within the budget and the ordinary establishing
`Prepare` otherwise. The forced-reincarnation machine proposes the same
schedules' batches as ordinary establishing `Prepare`s, one `Batch` entry
per step, the ordinary pipeline, and its memo-stream copy is the establishing
`Prepare` itself. Both machines commit what they journal: the fused slab's
per-slot stamps establish one era per establishing slot, while the single
`Batch` entry is one journal slot and establishes one era — the era numbering
follows the journal shape, the configuration sequence the batch folds is the
same either way, and the machine's guards, quorums, and commitments are
indifferent to the numbering.
