## 1. System under test

The system under test is the advisory-lock service built on this repository's
sans-IO VRR core. The reference implementation is the
[lunet-locks](https://github.com/lua-lunet/lunet-locks) demo, described here
from a fresh clone of that repository; every component name below is that
implementation's.

### 1.1 Components

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| `uvr-core` | The sans-IO VRR core. One total function; the host owns time, transport, storage, packetization, and naming. The adapter instantiates `Replica<SegmentedLog, WeightedMajority>` running `Stability::Volatile`: protocol state lives in quorum memory, not local storage. |
| Rust advisory-lock adapter | Owns the lock state machine, the tick clock, exactly-once reply correlation by `message_id`, and the durable recovery nonce. Executes only committed lock commands. |
| Teal/Lunet service process | `lunet-run build/server.lua`. Owns the TCP client endpoint (newline-delimited JSON), the UDP peer sockets, peer source validation, and forwarding. |
| LAL Peer Protocol | The service's raw-UDP framing and forwarding layer: envelope `\0LUNET_ADVISORY_LOCK_PEER\0` + kind + membership fingerprint + payload. The fingerprint is the first 16 lowercase hex characters of SHA-256 over the validated lexical member list. |
| Recovery nonce file | The `--state` path. The only bytes the service ever fsyncs: write, fsync, rename, parent-directory sync, per boot and per recovery retry. |
| Status surface | Each replica reports `normal`, `view_change`, `recovering`, or `replaying`, plus the current era, view, and the positional index of the current view's primary; `leader_for_view(era, view)` resolves the primary of an arbitrary era-and-view pair. |
| Event journal and console | Append-only binary journal of committed lock transitions (`hold`, `renew`, `release`), served by `lock-feed` over REST/WebSocket to the console SPA. Observability only: it never participates in replication or recovery. |

Timing knobs are the host flags `--heartbeat-ms`, `--election-ms`, and
`--recovery-ms`. Membership is fixed for one process lifetime.

### 1.2 The lock and the lease

The client object is an advisory **lock** held under a **lease**. It is never a
"leader"; the word leader names the VRR protocol role only.

The lock is a single compare-and-swap register, held entirely in quorum memory:
no disk. The register state is a `u32` client identifier and a `u32` holder
value; holder `0x0` means no holder, and no client identifier is `0x0`.

- **Startup / probe (`GET`):** the client reads the lock. If it is absent or
  expired, `GET` reports holder `0x0`. Whether a recorded lease has expired is
  judged in the **leader's clock**: the leader compares the lease's expiry
  against its own `now()` at execution time.
- **Acquisition (`SET`):** clients race to `SET` themselves as holder. Exactly
  one wins; the losers are rejected. The winner's lease duration is 100 ms: the
  leader reads `now() + 100 ms` as the future expiry, replicates the command
  through VRR, and responds.
- **Renewal (`BUMP`):** at approximately 80% of the 100 ms window the holder
  renews. `BUMP` is a CAS-style command conditional on the holder match: it
  **increases** the expiry by one window (100 ms), it does not write a new
  absolute time.
- **Contenders:** a rejected `SET` loser times out at `rand() * 100 ms` beyond
  the observed expiry, probes with `GET`, and sees the leader has renewed the
  lease out to the future timestamp; it does not take the lock while a live
  incumbent stands.
- **Round trip:** the client measures the round trip of every operation from
  its own clock (§7).

### 1.3 Cluster and labelling

Six nodes over raw UDP on the LAL Peer Protocol. Nodes are labelled `DC1_A`,
`DC1_B`, `DC2_A`, `DC2_B`, `DC3_A`, `DC3_B`, three data centres, two nodes
each. This is the FPAXOS label scheme, stated here as our labelling. The
lexically sorted member list is identical on every node; the membership
fingerprint guards against accidentally joining a differently configured
cluster.

## 2. Decision rule

The claim under test is diskless low latency: Crash-Stop-Reincarnation (CSR)
rejoin is faster than paying a forced disk flush at the reincarnation boundary. The
decision rule for the whole campaign:

> If the measured CSR rejoin latency (E1) is **slower** than the forced-flush
> baseline (E2 variant 1) at the same sample count, the diskless claim
> **collapses**. Success is CSR rejoin latency matching or beating the
> forced-flush baseline.

If rejoining is slower than doing disk flushes, nothing has been achieved.

## 3. E1, node-kill rejoin latency under CSR

**Question.** With normal lock traffic running, how long does a killed voting
node take to rejoin serving after reincarnation?

**Variables.**

- Node killed: one **voting** node that is **not** the UVR leader, rotated
  across all non-leader voting nodes.
- Traffic: continuous `SET`/`BUMP`/`GET` lock traffic from competing clients at
  the 100 ms lease cadence, throughout.
- Iterations: `k = xxxx` kill/rejoin cycles, **cold counts**: each iteration
  begins only after the previous rejoin has completed serving and a soak
  interval has elapsed, so no measurement is contaminated by the previous one.

**Procedure.** For each iteration: wait for steady state (all replicas
`normal`, leader serving); kill the selected node's process
(Crash-Stop: volatile state lost, the node is by construction a different node
on reopen); the cluster continues serving at quorum; the killed node bumps its
crash counter under the identity law (`docs/uvr-io-obligations.md`, the boot-gate chapter §5), rejoins as
a weight-0 member, and is walked back to voting
weight by the leader's forced reconfiguration sequence; the iteration ends when
the reincarnated node is again a voting, serving replica.

**Metric.** Kill→rejoin-serving latency, one sample per iteration:
distribution percentiles p50, p90, p99, max; mean; and the count of eras/view
changes consumed per rejoin. All values `xxxx`.

**Sample count.** `k = xxxx` iterations, split evenly across the rotated
non-leader voting nodes.

**Success rule.** Every iteration rejoins (no permanent loss of the killed
node); the distribution is reported for comparison under §2.

## 4. E2, disk modes at the reincarnation boundary

**Question.** What does the diskless default save, in latency, against paying a
forced flush at the reincarnation boundary?

Three variants, identical in every respect other than the durability behavior
at the reincarnation boundary (the point at which a reincarnating node durably
records state before rejoining serving):

**Variant 0, diskless (our default).** No durable writes at all at the
reincarnation boundary. Quorum memory is the only protocol state; the recovery nonce
file remains as shipped.

**Variant 1, naive single write (latency baseline).** One 4 KiB block write
followed by `fsync` at the reincarnation boundary: the direct-write approach of the
classic designs. Per FAST'18 (Alagappan et al., *Protocol-Aware Recovery for
Consensus-Based Storage*, USENIX FAST '18, Best Paper), even this single write
plus `fsync` is **not** fault-safe against real disk faults, it is included
only as the latency baseline, never as a safety claim.

**Variant 2, double-ring write.** A TigerBeetle-style double write, at the
reincarnation boundary: write one 4 KiB block containing one 64-byte cache line of
data plus a checksum header to the **first WAL ring**; then write the
header+checksum, with **no payload**, to the **second WAL ring**. The rings are
spaced apart per TigerBeetle's real layout: two separate fixed zones of the
data file, 4 KiB-sector aligned, so the two copies of the checksum sit in
different erasure blocks. Grounding: the TigerBeetle 0.17.9 protocol and disk
analysis ([the Director's gist](https://gist.github.com/simbo1905/3818c439bb08774f87bc8a92cc0a6ad5))
documents the production geometry this variant mirrors, 4x superblock writes
plus the WAL header flush, two durable direct writes per prepare (body, then
redundant header) before the acknowledgement, 1024-slot two-ring WAL, headers
ring separate from the prepares ring. Wild support for double-write/dual-ring
spacing is surveyed in §13.

**Both flush variants carry fake data only.** The payload may use the value of
the message being sent as junk; there is **never any read-back** in either
variant. The variants measure write-and-flush latency only; they never
reconstruct state from what was written.

**Variables.** Variant (0, 1, 2); node killed and traffic as in E1; iterations
`k = xxxx` per variant, cold counts.

**Procedure.** Exactly E1's procedure, per variant, against a custom build that
implements the variant's reincarnation-boundary behavior.

**Metric.** Kill→rejoin-serving latency distribution (percentiles as in E1)
per variant; plus, for variants 1 and 2, the reincarnation-boundary flush latency
itself (time from flush start to write completion) per iteration. All values
`xxxx`.

**Sample count.** `k = xxxx` iterations per variant.

**Success rule.** Variant 0 matches or beats variant 1 on the rejoin
distribution (§2). Variant 2 quantifies what the fault-safe flush would cost
against both.

## 5. E3, Maelstrom brute force at three and five nodes

**Question.** Does CSR hold consistency under brute-force fault injection?

Jepsen's Maelstrom drives the cluster under its fault profile with CSR as the
failure model: node crashes with volatile-state loss (the crashed node
reincarnates rather than crash-recovers), plus partitions. A Maelstrom adapter
process fronts the lock service, exposing the lock as a compare-and-set
register over Maelstrom's node protocol.

**Variables.** Cluster size: **three nodes**, then **five nodes**. Fault
profile: Maelstrom's crash and partition injections with the CSR
reincarnation behavior. Workload: competing lock clients at the §1.2 cadence.

**Checks.**

1. **Consistency under crash:** Maelstrom's linearizability check over the
   register passes for every run, no committed operation is lost, no
   amnesiac node rejoins under its old identity and overwrites a newer
   decision.
2. **Rejoin success:** every killed node reincarnates and rejoins serving; no
   run ends with a permanently lost node.
3. **No split decisions:** `GET` never reports two holders; expiry is judged
   only in the leader's clock.

**Procedure.** At three nodes, run Maelstrom with the CSR fault profile; then
repeat at five nodes. Iterations per cluster size: `xxxx`. All values `xxxx`.

**Sample count.** `xxxx` runs per cluster size.

**Success rule.** All runs pass all three checks. The result is presented as
supporting the case that CSR eliminates the FAST'18 weakness: consistency
under crash with successful rejoin, by construction rather than by recovery.

## 6. E4, cloud repetition

E1 and E2 are repeated on commodity cloud virtual machines, with the six-node
cluster laid out over three regions (two VMs each) matching the §1.3
labelling. Variables, procedure, metrics, and sample counts are E1's and E2's
unchanged; the environment differs (§12). All values `xxxx`.

## 7. E5, the failover budget: N round trips, no disk flush

**Question.** What does a view failover cost, decomposed into its wire
segments, and what does the classic diskful barrier add on identical hardware
in the same run?

**The design claim.** UVR failover costs suspicion floor + 2 RTT + 0
flushes: the StartViewChange dissemination is one RTT, the DoViewChange
collection is pipelined with it (zero extra RTT when the messages cross),
and the StartView installation is one RTT. The classic diskful alternative
pays the same floor and round trips plus a forced flush before fencing (the
VSR-1988-class stable-storage barrier) and a further flush before the new
primary may serve installed state.

**The forced-write rig (the counterfactual arm).** A custom test build of
the demonstration performs one 4 KiB write + `fsync` **outside** the
algorithm, before the fenced node emits its view-change traffic, and again
before the new primary answers StartView. The build never touches the core:
no UVR code is made unsafe, and nothing is rewritten to resemble the
compared systems; the rig prices their barrier by adding its cost on our
critical path, at the points where VSR-1988/VRR must write to be safe.

**Variables.** Arm (diskless, forced-flush); suspicion knob fixed per run;
`k = XXX` failovers per arm, cold counts as in E1.

**Metrics.** Per-segment medians (suspicion floor, each RTT leg, each
flush), and totals. Headline: total failover ours X.XX ms vs forced-flush
arm XX.X ms; flush cost per boundary X.XX ms, also expressed in units of the
same run's RTT as X.X RTTs, the hardware-agnostic ratio that should survive
moving rigs.

**Success rule.** The totals satisfy the identity `total = floor + 2 RTT`
(+2 flushes on the counterfactual arm) within the run's own noise; the
diskless arm matches or beats the flush arm's total.

## 8. E6, suspicion calibration under jitter: what phi actually saw

**Question.** The first rig runs showed the phi accumulator firing early:
its estimate sat far below the true round-trip time, and under
reconfiguration jitter its variance exploded. Which component owns the
variance, GC, scheduler jitter, or the estimator window shape?

**Instrumentation.** Per heartbeat window, sample: measured RTT; the phi
estimate; the estimator window's mean and variance; the LuaJIT allocation
counter (`collectgarbage("count")`) before and after the window; the
Rust-side tick gap distribution. Reconfiguration epochs are marked on the
same axis. Runtime context for the attribution: LuaJIT + FFI driving the
Rust core, small messages, no flush on the serving path, so the standing
noise budget is small and an outlier window is genuinely informative.

**Metrics.** Median phi estimate X.XX ms vs median RTT X.XX ms;
ninth-decile estimate XX.X ms vs ninth-decile RTT XX.X ms; attribution of
outlier windows: GC-attributed XX.X %, scheduler-attributed XX.X %,
unexplained XX.X %.

**Decision rule.** If GC explains the outlier windows, the estimator gets a
variance-capped window and a stated floor; if scheduler jitter dominates,
the floor moves to the measured jitter percentile. The paper reports which
and why.

## 9. Consistency checks, the figures must not contradict themselves

Every placeholder carries an implicit order of magnitude, and the lab book
checks it before any number is quoted. The rules:

1. No loopback-harness figure may be quoted beside a cloud claim, loopback
   round trips are tens of microseconds; intra-zone cloud round trips are
   not. Numbers from different rigs never mix in one sentence, one ratio,
   or one chart.
2. A failover figure must be at least its rig's suspicion floor plus two
   measured round trips. A failover quoted an order of magnitude faster
   than that rig's RTT is a measurement error, not a result.
3. A flush figure must be at least the device class's measured `fsync`
   latency. A flush quoted an order of magnitude below the block device's
   own measurement is the same class of error.
4. Ratios are formed only within one rig and one run.
5. A failover measured on an all-in-memory harness (no network between
   nodes) may be reported only as a harness figure; it supports no claim
   about networked failover.

These checks exist because the errors they prevent are the ones that look
amazing: the contradiction is not visible until the figure sits next to the
rig's RTT, and a reader who reproduces the rig will see it immediately.

## 10. The lab-book run sheet

One row per figure, completed before the figure enters the paper; the run
sheets live as dated entries under `docs/labbook/`. Columns:

| column | content |
|---|---|
| figure | paper figure/table row this measurement feeds |
| run id | harness run identifier + commit SHA of every component |
| rig | loopback / local VM / cloud (region, zone, instance class) |
| date + clock | wall-clock start; clock discipline used |
| knobs | heartbeat, election, phi, recovery intervals; sample count |
| raw artifact | path to the raw capture + its checksum |
| percentiles | p50 / p90 / p99 / max / mean as measured |
| bound check | the §9 bound for this rig, and pass/fail |
| anomalies | GC pauses, reconfigs, scheduler events inside the window |
| verdict | the number that may be quoted, in the paper's sig figs |

## 11. Timing measurement

- **Client round trip:** every operation's round trip is measured by the
  client: a monotonic clock reading taken immediately before the request line
  is written to the TCP connection and immediately after the response line is
  read. One sample per operation; distributions reported as percentiles.
- **Expiry decisions:** expiry is judged in the **leader's** clock. The leader
  reads `now()` on its own host at execution time, the adapter's monotonic,
  nondecreasing milliseconds-since-Unix-epoch tick, clamped per node so a
  wall-clock regression never reaches the core. The lease expiry is stamped as
  leader `now() + 100 ms` on `SET` and advanced by one window on `BUMP`.
- **Cross-host comparison:** the leader's response echoes the execution-time
  tick, so a client can interpret expiry against the leader's timeline without
  assuming synchronized clocks.

## 12. Environment plan

- **Local timing runs:** a lima virtual machine on the Director's machine runs
  the timing experiments (E1, E2 local legs). All timing runs happen inside
  the VM so the host's load does not contaminate percentiles.
- **Docker is functional only:** the local Colima Docker daemon has no BuildKit
  and no disk sharing, so Docker never produces timings. Docker is for
  **functional tests**, docker-compose the six-node cluster and prove the
  cluster boots and serves with its dependencies. Base image: Debian Trixie;
  `aarch64` on this host, `x86_64` elsewhere; the arm64 build must boot with
  dependencies installed.
- **Cloud:** commodity virtual machines for E4, three regions, two VMs each.
- **Target hardware note:** the Director's target box class is M5-series Macs
  with 2T disk. Local timings target that class.
