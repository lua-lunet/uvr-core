# Architecture

`uvr-core` is a SANS-I/O library with a C ABI, not a framework. It never tells the host
what to do.

Section references are to `docs/uvr-durability-model.md`. Rulings are the decision
record at the end of this document.

## Closed for modification

The VSR-2012 invariants and the quorum-intersection obligations. Specifically:

```text
R1: QI_e ⌢ QII_e            (§8.7.4)
R2: QI_e ⌢ QII_(e+1)        (§8.7.4)
F_g ⌢ R_g                   (§8.3, diskless)
V_g ⌢ V_g                   (§8.3, diskless self-intersection)
```

These are mechanically checked, the family-intersection obligations by the free
functions `quorum::validate_era`/`quorum::validate_transition`, the
transition-legality rules by `invariant::legal`. No host, feature flag, or extension may
weaken them. `V_g ⌢ V_g` is called out separately because it does not follow from
`QI ⌢ QII` alone, and its absence is the usual way a flexible-quorum
policy satisfying `QI ⌢ QII` is nevertheless an invalid VRR-2012 policy. The
open/closed ruling itself, with the counterexample that makes the gate necessary, is Q1
in the decision record below.

## Open for extension

Quorum families, journal durability, packetization, state transfer, clocks, security, node
naming and node-id assignment, transaction and locking discipline.

These are host policy. We ship a default and a trait; we do not ship a choice.

## We do not ship configurations

We write protocols in Rust. A design decision that *precludes* a legal host policy is a
defect, and is to be reported as one.

## The clock is externalised

The core performs no clock reads. The transition is

```text
tick + message + state -> state + list(messages)
```

Every input carries the host tick, and for a restart input that tick is a restart
nonce; the attempt retains a bounded set of them, one per re-drive (§6.1, S4).

Timeout policy is host policy in the same sense, and the core publishes a
recommendation rather than a timer. For the view-change timeout: size the unit at
`2×rtt`, the first window is one unit split evenly into a fixed and a uniform
random half, so the earliest suspicion is a full round trip after the last observed
activity; a 20 ms unit presumes ~10 ms RTT, ~5 ms one-way between two DCs. Each
failed or interrupted election attempt doubles the window (unit, `2·unit`,
`4·unit`, …, capped at 5000 ms), split into a fixed part and a uniform random part
that both grow with the window, the fixed part so a duel survivor gets real work
done inside its window, the random part so dueling hosts' timers spread and one
election completes while the other waits, and the counter resets to the unit on
commit or adopt. The host draws the random part and delivers its ticks; the core
only counts. The schedule's arithmetic is published as pure functions in `backoff`;
the recommendation is documented on `ViewChangeKnobs`.

`ids` depends on nothing. `Fault` lives in `ids`, not in `invariant`,
precisely so that `invariant::legal` can consume `Progress` without `progress` importing
anything back from `invariant`: that edge would close a cycle, and cycles are
prohibited. `invariant` re-exports `Fault` so existing citations keep compiling.
`quorum` depends on `configuration` and `ids` and holds the closed family-intersection
gate as free functions (Q1); `invariant` holds the closed transition-legality checker.
Both are depended on by `replica`, so no path reaches a proposal without passing the
gates. `effects` is a leaf: nothing in the core consumes an effect, because effects are
returned to the host, never performed. `observe` reads `progress` and is read by nothing
inside the core; it exists for the host and the C ABI. `backoff` has no edges at all:
it depends on nothing inside the core and nothing inside the core depends on it, pure
arithmetic published for the host (the randomized-timeout recommendation, S4).

The graph above is acyclic, and stays so by ruling. A proposed edge that would create a
cycle is a signal that a responsibility is in the wrong module.

Perimeter shapes are enforced at module perimeters: IO, network, storage, and
boundaries between logic layers. Data crossing a perimeter is validated there,
once. Maturities are never mixed in one unit of work: scaffolding for a spike
and the core of a platform carry different obligations and do not belong in the
same change.

## The contiguity gap rule

Normal operation's contiguity guard (§13.1 step 5) drops a `Prepare` whose slot is
past the accepted frontier's successor and publishes `Diagnostic::GapDetected` on the
observation; the fetch half of the ruling, a `GetState` for the missing range,
rides the same transition. A `Commit` carries a frontier, not a slot: it is clamped
to the local accepted frontier and never claims what the journal does not record
(§5 invariant 2), so a gap can never enter through the commit path.

Host obligation at the sans-I/O boundary: a host detects `slot > local frontier` at
its boundary and treats the epoch as stalled until state transfer repairs the log;
an era change is the lawful repair. The core publishes the named diagnostic and runs
the fetch; the repair decision is the host's.

## Host obligations for correct running

The core performs no clock reads and opens no sockets; a host carries the
obligations below. Each is stated as the end state, a host that meets them runs
the protocol correctly.

### Vocabulary: restarting is not crash recovery

The `Restarting` status is our own language for the start a boot gate classifies as
clean, the classic VRR-2012 notion of recovery, but only over a clean shutdown and a
full reload of all durable state. A start that cannot prove those is not a recovery
at all: there is no crash-recovery protocol, because there is no crash to recover
from. A node that lost volatile state is by construction a different node
(`docs/uvr-protocols.md`, the reincarnation chapter §1) and re-enters
through reincarnation, not
recovery. Nothing in the clean stop/start/sync path or the reincarnation path may
deviate from that: clean stop/start/sync runs the ordinary restart (all four
superblocks read `flushed`), reincarnation runs the crash-stop-self-evict sequence.

### Reincarnation: the leader's obligations on hearing the announcement

A bumped node announces `(old, new)` to **all** nodes; **only the leader
responds**, and it does so immediately, before it starts the cluster's forced
reconfiguration, because the announcement is safe to answer at once: the
announcer is not a member of the cluster, its messages are discarded by the
membership-discard check, and its votes are never counted.

- **Immediate ack.** The leader acknowledges the announcement at once and arms
  the forced sequence without waiting for the first era to commit.
- **Memo streaming.** From that moment the leader sends all phase-1 and phase-2
  messages to the reincarnated node even though it is not in the cluster, so it
  stays up to date from the first era of the sequence onward.
- **Sync from the announcement.** The announcement carries the slot the
  reincarnated node had committed in its past life and what it had prepared; the
  leader's ack carries the new era and pushes what the node missed, so it
  synchronises to the frontier immediately and then stays current by the memo
  stream.

### The reincarnated node's obligations

In this mode the node does not vote. It has to hear that a cluster
reconfiguration has committed that puts it in the cluster with a non-zero voting
weight before it will vote. Until then every rule of the membership-discard check
applies to it in both directions: messages FROM it are discarded, messages TO it
are fine, and its weight of `0` keeps it out of every quorum. This is what makes
answering the announcement before the reconfiguration safe.

### The leader's admin ingress

A leader exposes its reconfiguration plan ingress on a dedicated admin
endpoint, separate from regular client traffic. On every message selection
the host polls the admin ingress BEFORE the regular queue, so a plan never
waits behind client traffic; the leader-side acceptance and execution rule
the obligation serves is pinned in `docs/uvr-protocols.md` (the solver chapter).

### Liveness: the resend, the heartbeat, and the retransmit

The core performs no clock reads and opens no sockets: every message it approves
is released as an effect, once, and every timeout the cluster's liveness rests
on is the host's. Whatever the timeout durations and whatever mechanism arms
them, they are the host's. A repeated send is a relay of what the core has
already released, never a message the host composes (the authorization rule for
replayed messages of `uvr-durability-model.md` §13.2; retransmission is host
transport policy there). The papers make the repeated send the implementation's
matter: the protocol descriptions of Viewstamped Replication Revisited (2012)
ignore "re-sending of messages that appear to have been lost" as a minor detail
(§4.2; the same convention at §4.1's opening, "re-sending protocol messages that
haven't received responses").

**The leader's resend policy.** A leader that times out without the quorum
response a message of its own emission awaits resends what it has not received a
response on. The leader's record of each outstanding proposal holds the
respondents so far (`proposals`, `src/replica/mod.rs:1176-1179`, the record
shape at `src/replica/mod.rs:706-719`) and is resolved only by the applied
acknowledgement (`src/replica/mod.rs:1996-1998`); the matters it has not
received responses on are the records still standing. Phase-1 and phase-2
traffic both get the policy: the repeated send covers the proposal whose
`PrepareOk` quorum has not closed and the commit announcements that carry the
frontier, and a resend is safe because each receiver is idempotent on repeats
(a repeated `Prepare` re-acknowledges without re-applying,
`tests/normal_operation.rs:384-385` and the duplicate-`PrepareOk` drop at
`src/replica/normal.rs:465-467`; the commit handler takes the frontier each
time, `src/replica/normal.rs:672-676`). The source convention is Viewstamped
Replication Revisited (2012) §4.1, in which the primary re-sends a proposal that
is lagging rather than proposing past it.

**The heartbeat, one option among many.** A leader with no outstanding matters
(no proposal record standing) and matching frontiers (its accepted and
committed frontiers have met) may, on its timeout, send its last commit as a
heartbeat, which serves both as the frontier announcement and as the proof of
life the backups' suspicion reads. The option is suggestion-grade in the
sources: the idle emission of the latest commit is one idle shape Viewstamped
Replication Revisited (2012) §4.1 describes ("if the primary does not receive a
new client request in a timely way, it instead informs the backups of the
latest commit by sending them a ⟨COMMIT v, k⟩ message", with the paper's own
note that there commit-number equals op-number, the frontiers matching), and
the timeout measures of Paxos Made Simple (2001) are implementation
suggestions, liveness instruments whose failure never touches safety. Any
other leader timeout mechanism is allowable in its place; no mechanism is
required, and the duration is the host's.

**The view-change retransmit.** A node that times out on its view-change
request set, the `StartViewChange` fence votes it has emitted and the
`DoViewChange` evidence it owes the designated primary
(`src/replica/view_change.rs:44-60` and `src/replica/view_change.rs:231-265`),
retransmits the datagrams of that set: the attempt is volatile
(`src/replica/mod.rs:1188-1191`) and nothing else will re-ask, so a lost
request otherwise strands the attempt. The receiving side absorbs repeats: a
fence vote is a set member, counted once (`src/replica/mod.rs:752-753`), and a
repeated evidence delivery is absorbed on the sender's key, the first delivery
standing, the vote counted once (`src/replica/view_change.rs:413-418`). The
retransmit is the same host transport replay the papers leave to the
implementation (Viewstamped Replication Revisited (2012) §4.2's ignored minor
detail, quoted above).

## Decision record

Each decision states context, decision, consequence. These are rulings, not proposals.
A later item may not contradict one; it may only supersede one by amending this section
and saying so.

Identifiers are per-domain: `W` identity & wire, `S` durability & stability, `Q` quorum
policy, `B` application boundary, `G` runtime guards & enforcement, `P` process & hygiene.
Numbering is within the domain.
Section references are to `docs/uvr-durability-model.md`.

### Identity & wire

#### W1, Explicit `Ballot { era: u32, view: u32 }`, 20-byte big-endian header

**Context.** Overlap mode (§8.7.7) has the primary address era `e` and era `e+1` in the
same instant, so the era authorising a message is a transport-visible routing fact about
that message, not an attribute of the sender's state.

**Decision.** A view is `Ballot { era: u32, view: u32 }`. The wire header is 20 bytes
big-endian: `(tag: u32, era: u32, view: u32, slot: u64)`. No bit packing appears anywhere
in the wire format.

**Rationale.**

1. Overlap-mode routing must be explicit: era is a first-class header field, and a host
   dispatches on it without inspecting protocol state.
2. Two independent `u32` fields cannot alias, so each counter's exhaustion is detected
   independently.

**Consequence.** Primary selection is `config(era).order[view mod len(order)]`,
view-number gaps are legal, and a replica may propose a view only if its accepted
history contains that era's establishing reconfiguration.

#### W2, No `uuid`; identifiers are host-supplied

**Context.** The alpha depended on `uuid` with the `v4` and `serde` features to mint
identifiers, which requires a randomness source inside a library that is supposed
to have no ambient inputs.

**Decision.** Identifiers are host-supplied: `OperationId` is the example. The host
supplies it. The core never mints one.
`uuid` is removed and must appear nowhere in the manifest.

**Consequence.** A host that wants UUIDv4 identifiers can produce them; a host with an
existing correlation-id discipline uses that instead; a deterministic simulation harness
uses counters. Combined with W3 this makes the non-optional dependency set empty, which is
what `tests/manifest_contract.rs` gates.

#### W3, Own binary codec in `wire`, optional serde derives, JSON debug bridge

**Context.** The alpha put JSON in the datagram path. §13.1's bounded view-change suffix
requires the encoded size of a candidate history suffix to be computable exactly before it
is sent.

**Decision.** A binary big-endian codec in `wire` is normative. `serde` derives sit behind
the `serde` feature. A binary-to-JSON debug bridge sits behind `maelstrom`.

**Rationale.** Binary on the wire makes the §13.1 suffix budget deterministic, a
serializer whose output length depends on number formatting cannot answer "does this
suffix fit". Serde derives behind a feature let a host impose its own encoding without
forking. The debug bridge means the *binary* path is the one under test while the failure
output is still readable; a JSON-native debug path would exercise the wrong codec.

**Consequence.** Two encoders to keep in step, and a round-trip property test is
mandatory rather than optional.

**Amendment.** The dev-dependency allowlist that bounds the round-trip test's format is
decision P3.

#### W4, Fixed-width big-endian, no varints

**Context.** A variable-length integer encoding is smaller on the wire.

**Decision.** Every integer is fixed-width big-endian. No varints, no zigzag, no bit
packing.

**Rationale.** W3's entire justification for a binary codec is that `packed_len()`
answers "does this suffix fit" *exactly*, before any bytes are produced. A varint's
length depends on its value, so a suffix budget becomes a search rather than a sum.
Big-endian because it is the network order the wire already implies and because it makes
a hex dump readable in the same order as the struct definition.

**Consequence.** Larger datagrams than a varint encoding. Accepted, the host owns
packetization (W5) and can compress a whole datagram if it cares, which is a better place
for that trade than inside a protocol invariant.

#### W5, No `MAX_DATAGRAM` in the core

**Context.** The alpha embedded datagram sizing, so the core made packetization decisions
using a constant chosen at compile time by someone who did not know the transport.

**Decision.** No maximum datagram size, chunk size, or fragment count constant exists in
the core. Encoders report the size they require; decoders report incomplete input. The
host owns all packetization and all state-transfer sizing.

**Consequence.** Every encode site returns a required-size signal that callers must
handle, and every decode site distinguishes "malformed" from "incomplete". More surface
area in the codec API, in exchange for a core that cannot be wrong about an MTU it was
never told.

#### W6, Fuse is a wire shape, not a protocol semantic

**Context.** A multi-era reconfiguration schedule was proposed slot by slot, so a
three-node reincarnation paid one round trip per era transition. The temptation was a
new message family with its own state machine.

**Decision.** Fuse is message packing. One datagram carries the schedule's per-slot
`Prepare` messages: the head ballot in the header, `first_slot`, `count ×
SystemOperation`. Every packed slot carries its own ballot, computed by the
solver as it folds the schedule slot by slot; the header carries only the first of
them. Accepting a Phase2 at a slot promises that slot's ballot even when the
Phase1 was lost, so the acceptor ends promised at the tail ballot, the slab's last.
Per-op safety is the ordinary accept path. Replies are
`FuseOk` and `CommitBatch` batches of slots, never ranges. The envelope is atomic in
transport (single checksummed datagram, cache-line scale), so the first op in the batch
decides the whole batch and no proof over interruptions mid-reconfiguration is owed.
The builder caps the schedule (`FUSE_MAX_OPS`, a build-site policy) and falls back to
ordinary per-op `Prepare`s; the codec itself keeps no size constant, per W5. Full
statement: `docs/uvr-fuse.md`.

**Consequence.** Three new tags and a build-site guard instead of a parallel protocol.
The reconfiguration machine is untouched; the wire contract gains three golden
vectors.

### Durability & stability

#### S1, Journal reclamation is host policy and is absent from the trait

**Context.** §4 lists exactly four required journal capabilities: identify the accepted
frontier, read history, record acceptance, record a view selection. It lists no physical
retention operation, and states explicitly that none of truncation, rotation, segment
management, size threshold, age threshold or minimum retention is a VRR-2012 state
transition.

**Decision.** The portable `Journal` trait contains no reclamation operation. A host
implements whatever retention policy it likes without exposing it to the core, provided it
either satisfies a protocol read or reports the requested history unavailable, at which
point restart or state transfer obtains an adequate state elsewhere.

The default `SegmentedLog` reclaims lazily and opportunistically on append, gated on a
published checkpoint. Few knobs: initial slab capacity, growth factor, shrink hint. A unit
or stress run that never reclaims at all is a legitimate configuration, not a leak.

**Consequence.** No host can be locked out by a retention obligation it cannot meet, and
no test can be flaky because reclamation ran at an inconvenient moment. The cost is that
disk growth is not the core's problem and the core will not warn about it.

#### S2, Stability is `plan` / `publish` / confirm; no host callbacks across the ABI

**Context.** §7 and §12 require the host to serialize the publication interval. A
callback-based durability hook is the conventional design.

**Decision.** A three-phase handshake: the core produces a `plan`, the host performs the
durability action, the host `publish`es and confirms the outcome. No host callback is
invoked from inside the core, and none crosses the C ABI.

**Rationale.** A callback invoked inside `publish` would re-enter the §12 serialized
transition interval. The reentrancy is not analysable, and across a C ABI it is not even
type-checkable.

**Consequence.** `begin`/`end` and `lock`/`unlock` are documented host-side **wrapping**
patterns, not core traits, the host wraps its call to the core, the core does not call
into the host's transaction. §11.1 (application inside the host transaction) and §11.2
(application outside it) are both expressible, which is the point.

#### S3, Three-way `StabilityResult`

**Context.** A persistence attempt has three outcomes, not two: it succeeded, it
definitely did not succeed, or the host cannot tell.

**Decision.**

```text
StabilityResult = Stable { receipt }
                | Failed { reason }
                | Indeterminate { reason }
```

Only `Indeterminate` sticky-faults the node (§5, invariant 5). `Failed` leaves the
previously published state visible and observable.

**Rationale.** Collapsing "it definitely did not happen" into "it might have happened"
discards exactly the information that distinguishes a retry from a restart. A determinate
failure is a normal, survivable event; treating it as a fault converts a full disk into an
outage.

**Consequence.** Hosts must be able to report indeterminacy honestly. A host that reports
`Failed` for a timeout it cannot actually disprove has violated the contract, and the
resulting divergence is the host's, so this is stated in the trait's documentation and not
merely assumed.

#### S4, Externalised clock; the restart nonce is the host tick

**Context.** §6.1 makes `TimedInput.at` an opaque host-supplied `u64` and derives the
restart nonce from it. The alpha took a caller-supplied nonce separately from time,
allowing the two to disagree.

**Decision.** Every input carries the host tick. The core performs no clock reads. For a
restart input the tick **is** a restart nonce, and the attempt retains a bounded set of
them, one per re-drive. `Input::Tick` exists as an ordinary
event.

**Rationale.** One value cannot disagree with itself. The §6.1 invariant, no recovery
attempt may reuse a nonce while a message from an earlier attempt can still be delivered,
becomes a property of the host's declared clock strategy, which §6.1 already tabulates for
continuous-nanosecond, continuous-millisecond, and resettable clocks. `Input::Tick` as an
event rather than a timer callback lets a harness replay sloppy, late, early and reordered
timeouts deterministically; a timeout the core cannot be *told* about is a timeout no test
can reproduce.

**Consequence.** The core needs no monotonic-clock abstraction and no time crate. A host
with a resettable clock must construct a fresh `u64` by another method (§6.1); the core
cannot detect that failure and does not pretend to.

### Quorum policy

#### Q1, Open/closed: quorum families are an extension point, intersection is closed

**Context.** §8.2 argues that quorum policy is a family of legal sets, not a count.
§8.4 admits weighted families, §8.5 admits the even-node split `V_g = k+1, C_g = k`, and
§8.7 admits reconfiguration by voting weight. These are genuinely different operational
profiles with different latency and availability, and only the host knows which it wants.
But every one of them must still satisfy the intersection obligations, and the obligations
are not obvious enough to leave to reviewers.

**Decision.** `QuorumStrategy` is an extension point. The obligations
`R1: QI_e ⌢ QII_e` and `R2: QI_e ⌢ QII_(e+1)` (§8.7.4), together with the diskless
obligations `F_g ⌢ R_g` and `V_g ⌢ V_g` (§8.3), are closed for modification and are
mechanically checked in `crate::invariant`. No host, feature flag, or extension may weaken
them. Validation is over families, not counts: the threshold inequality `T_a + T_b > W`
(§8.4) is sufficient but not necessary for an arbitrary indivisible weight assignment, so
a strategy validated only by thresholds is treated as unvalidated.

`WeightedMajority` is the default, because §8.7.5 proves its closure across consecutive
eras. `EvenSplit` ships as a non-default *reference* strategy to prove the
extension point admits the six-node three-datacentre profile. We ship a default and a
trait. We do not ship a choice.

The mechanical check lives in `crate::quorum` as the free
functions `validate_era`/`validate_transition`, not as `invariant` code and not as trait
methods: free functions are what makes the gate un-overridable by a strategy value.
`invariant` retains the transition-legality checker `legal`. The discharge mechanism is
exhaustive subset enumeration over the membership, bounded by
`configuration::MAX_MEMBERS = 16`, a validation-cost bound, not a protocol limit.

**The counterexample that makes the gate necessary.** Six members, all unit weight, so
`T = 6`. A commit threshold of `C = 4` and a view-change threshold of `V = 4` both
intersect within an era. Now propose `INCREMENT(n0)`:

```text
era e:      W = (1,1,1,1,1,1),  T = 6
era e+1:    W = (2,1,1,1,1,1),  T = 7

V_e     = 4  admits  {n1,n2,n3,n4}          weight 4 under era e
C_(e+1) = 3  admits  {n0,n5}                weight 3 under era e+1

{n1,n2,n3,n4} ∩ {n0,n5} = ∅
```

`R2` is violated: a view change in era `e` can select a history that omits an operation
committed by the era-`e+1` commit quorum. The validator must **refuse `INCREMENT(n0)`
before it is proposed**. Detecting this after the reconfiguration commits is worthless,
the divergence is already reachable and no later check can un-commit it.

**The half-total threshold note.** `C = floor(T/2)` gives `C + V = T` when `T` is odd,
which means the two families may be exactly complementary and share no member at all. A
half-total commit threshold is therefore admissible **only for even totals**, which is
precisely the §8.5 case `T = 2k`, `C = k`, `V = k+1`, where `C + V = 2k + 1 > T`. Any
strategy offering a half-total threshold must reject odd totals rather than round.

**Consequence.** `invariant` refuses configurations and reconfiguration operations, not
just messages. A `QuorumStrategy` that cannot enumerate or characterise its families well
enough to be validated is not usable, and that is intentional.

#### Q2, The voting-weight domain {0,1,2}; join at 0, leave at 0; era batches move ≤ 1 unit of mass

**Context.** Voting weights are common factors: `18/27` is `2/3`, so no node ever needs a
weight above `2`, and a uniform double or halve is a zero op on quorum families. Standbys
TigerBeetle's term for its non-voting cluster members (weight 0; older drafts called
them learners), never vote and are not counted against any quorum: standby nodes have a
zero voting weight so cannot form part of any quorum nor actively participate in the VSR
algorithm. A nine-node deployment
of three voting nodes across three data centres is a three-node cluster with six warm
standbys. Reconfiguration must be checkable *before* it is proposed, with no way to
compress a two-step identity swap into one era.

**Decision.** The voting-weight domain is `{0, 1, 2}` (`configuration::MAX_WEIGHT = 2`).
A node joins at weight 0 and leaves only at weight 0; there is no operation that joins
elsewhere and no legal fold that removes a voter. Zero-weight standbys receive prepare
and commit traffic so they stay swappable in, and every replica discards
vote/view-change messages from a non-voting identity (the `Reincarnation` announcement is
the one exempted message). One reconfiguration commits a **batch**: either one solitary
scaling operation (`DOUBLE`/`HALVE`, refused with company), or a unit batch whose
per-node mass moved `Σ|W_before(a) − W_after(a)|` over the union node set is at most `1`.
The rule is stated over per-node mass moved, not over the net total change: the
zero-net, mass-2 identity swap is refused, and a leader crash cannot compress it.
The leader evaluates any batch as a what-if on an immutable clone before proposing it,
and the reducer partitions an operation stream into maximal legal era batches
(`src/reconfiguration.rs`). The itemized rules are
`docs/uvr-protocols.md` (the reconfiguration-rules chapter).

**Rationale.**

1. The named mathematics is enough: two strict majorities intersect by the pigeonhole
   principle; majorities intersect when per-node mass moved is ≤ 1 (Turner's
   Lemma 2, formalized as ladder rung 9 `WeightedGeneral.scaled_overlap`); uniform
   scaling preserves every quorum family by common-factor normalization.
2. A net-total rule alone would admit the mass-2 swap `(1,1,1) → (1,1,c:0,d:1)`, whose
   era-`e` majority `{b,c}` and era-`e+1` majority `{a,d}` are disjoint, exactly the
   Q1 counterexample shape, caught here before consensus rather than after.
3. More eras are free (§8.7.2's non-stop transition makes each one cheap); proving that
   two commands acted as one without a violation is work no one needs to do twice.

**Consequence.** The fold refuses any operation or batch that would leave the domain
{0,1,2}, join or remove a voter, combine scaling ops with anything, or move more than one
unit of per-node mass. Cluster state is an immutable snapshot plus a WAL of legal
operations; there is no Crash-Recover by design, a dirty node reincarnates under a new
identity and the leader drives the forced sequence
(`docs/uvr-protocols.md`, the reincarnation chapter §6).

### Application boundary

#### B1, Seqlock over a POD snapshot for lockless observation

**Context.** §12 requires the host to serialize the transition interval. Diagnostics,
metrics and the C ABI must read `Progress` from outside that interval. The obvious
alternative is an `Arc` swap with reader counting.

**Decision.** A seqlock over a plain-old-data snapshot. Even sequence means stable, odd
means write in progress, a reader that observes a torn read retries. Not `Arc` swap.

**Rationale.** There is **no reclamation race to prove**. Nothing is freed, so there is no
epoch scheme, no hazard pointer, and no deferred drop whose soundness argument would have
to be re-established by every later item that touches the snapshot layout. The failure
mode we are buying out of is the one that does not reproduce under test.

**Consequence.** A reader may spin under a write storm. Acceptable: writes are bounded by
the transition rate and the snapshot is a handful of words. `unsafe` is confined to
`observe` and `ffi`; the crate carries `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` rather than `forbid`
precisely so those two modules can each hold one scoped, documented exception.
Observation is read-only without exception (§15): no mutation through diagnostic,
transport, timer or transfer side channels.

#### B2, The core orders opaque operations; clients are a host concern

**Context.** The VRR-2012 paper ships a per-client table (latest request number plus
cached result per client, at most one outstanding request per client) as duplicate
suppression and result replay for a request/response service shape. A generic
embeddable core cannot assume that shape: hosts include fire-and-forget producers,
streamed pipelines, and proxies with their own retry semantics. Modelling clients
inside consensus couples the protocol to one transport shape and forces table
propagation through every view-change and restart message as protocol evidence.

**Decision.** An operation is `{ id: OperationId, payload: bytes }` where
`OperationId` is an opaque 128-bit correlation token `{ msb: u64, lsb: u64 }`. The
core never compares identifiers for duplicate detection, never assigns retry
semantics, and never suppresses a repeated identifier, the host protocol decides
whether a repetition is a retry, a duplication, or another valid invocation. Every
replica emits the same ordered `(slot, OperationId, payload)` application upcall;
the host answers with `Applied { slot }`, which carries no result. Application
results never enter consensus state. A host may keep an ephemeral
`OperationId → pending request` association and returns a result only while that
association exists, discarding it otherwise; a crash clears associations, so an I/O
failure leaves the write outcome unknowable to the caller, who must reconnect and
query according to the host protocol. Transport, leader forwarding, connection
tracking, and response formatting remain host extensions. The role a node
holds when it terminates alien application traffic is the **gateway**; the
gateway, the session it holds, and the obligations an application protocol
owes are specified in `docs/uvr-application-protocol.md`. The reference
client-facing deployment (a two-site cluster behind a layer-4 load balancer,
the command circuit from accept to reply, and where the paper's
one-outstanding-request rule lands in the host) is stated in
`docs/clients.md`.

**Recorded API consequences** (normative for the implementation items that follow):

- `OperationId` replaces `ClientId`, `RequestNumber`, and client-semantics uses of the
  16-byte message-correlation identifier, which is thereby fully superseded and
  removed from the public surface.
- `Input::Client` becomes `Input::Propose { operation }`; every application-origin
  log entry stores the complete identifier and the opaque payload.
- `Effect::Apply` carries `{ slot, operation_id, payload }`; `Input::Applied` is
  `{ slot }` only.
- Protocol `Request`/`Reply` messages as client transport, `Effect::Reply`, all
  client tables, cached results, merge rules, result re-drive state, and
  client-table fields in view-change and restart messages are removed. Correlation
  identifiers survive view change and restart because they are part of the log
  entries themselves; no table is protocol evidence.

**Consequence.** Multiple operations from one host may be in flight concurrently.
Submitting one identifier twice is not silently deduplicated. Only a host retaining
a pending association returns an application result; every other replica discards
it. The client-table design explored during the rewrite is superseded and must not
be integrated. A demonstration application (a clustered diskless byte stack) is
deferred until after the full verification gate; its transport choices remain host
decisions and set no core precedent.

### Runtime guards

#### G1, Two runtime tiers: asserted invariants and maybes

**Context.** The core already holds compile-time unrepresentability (`const _:
() = assert!(...)` sanity and constructors that refuse illegal states), the
closed `invariant::legal` checker that faults impossible LOCAL transitions, and
the §4 totality that drops hostile peer input by name on the Diagnostic record.
No documented rule says which runtime condition deserves which treatment, so
every new module re-decides it.

**Decision.** The runtime rule is two-tier:

- **Invariants**, conditions whose impossibility the surrounding code
  establishes. Asserted with `assert!`, always, release included. A violation
  is a bug in the core itself, never a hostile input.
- **Maybes**, conditions that are not provably impossible and are typically
  adversary- or environment-adjacent. They panic in test and debug builds, so a
  suite or smoke run surfaces them; in release they continue and surface
  through the named Diagnostic surface.

**Consequence.** A condition is assigned to one tier by this rule, not
re-decided per module. The §4 guards' named drops are the established shape for
peer-input maybes: total, named, never faulting the node. An `assert!` is never
a stand-in for a hostile-input check, and a hostile-input check is never a
stand-in for an `assert!`.

#### G2, Identity monotonicity is an asserted invariant

**Context.** The bump is the sole constructor of a higher identity. A wrapped
or recycled identity would make a superseded one indistinguishable from a
current one, the amnesiac voter of §14.2 by another name.

**Decision.** Identity monotonicity is asserted at the bump: the pair identity
the bump returns is strictly beyond the one it supersedes in the lawful
ordering of `docs/uvr-io-obligations.md`, the boot-gate chapter §5, so a
superseded pair never re-enters
circulation. The surrounding bounded arithmetic establishes the impossibility;
the `assert!` at the bump site is the tripwire, release included. The
exhaustion refusal (the bump at the counter bound returning `None`) is the
refusal path, not a violation.

**Consequence.** A future change to the identity arithmetic that could recycle
a superseded pair into circulation faults at the bump instead of circulating
silently.

#### G3, Maybes surface through the Diagnostic they already flow through

**Context.** The core reads no clock, opens no socket, and holds no log (S4,
S1): it cannot log, warn, or report except by returning data to the host. The
Diagnostic record is a seqlock-protected last-value snapshot (B1).

**Decision.** No host-report surface this release. A maybe in the core
continues in release and surfaces through the Diagnostic it already flows
through. A host-report hook, a host-set report function or a trait value
passed at construction, is an amendment to this record, not a quiet addition.

**Consequence.** The Diagnostic record holds only the latest transition's
outcome: two rapid drops overwrite each other, and a host that never polls it
sees nothing. The host's stall-detection obligation is stated with the
contiguity gap rule above.

### Process & hygiene

#### P1, `.tmp/` is never committed

**Context.** `.tmp/` is the working-tree scratch directory: untracked artifacts
such as captured outputs and the overlap crash matrix's `failure.log` live there.

**Decision.** `.tmp/` is scratch and is never committed. The `.gitignore` entry
is written `.tmp/` with the trailing slash so it unambiguously names a directory.
Normative documents live in `docs/` and are tracked.

**Consequence.** Scratch artifacts such as `failure.log` stay on disk untracked;
the overlap crash matrix mines it for regression signatures from the working
tree, not from history.

#### P2, MIT

**Context.** `Cargo.toml` declared `Apache-2.0`. `LICENSE` is MIT and `README.md` says
MIT. Two of three sources agreed.

**Decision.** MIT. `Cargo.toml` is corrected.

**Consequence.** `tests/manifest_contract.rs` asserts `license = "MIT"` and asserts that
no residual `Apache` string remains, so the disagreement cannot silently return.

#### P3, Dependency stance: empty non-optional set, allowlisted dev-dependencies

**Context.** The W3 `--features serde` round trip needs some format to serialize
*through*. An earlier attempt hand-rolled a `Serializer`/`Deserializer` pair inside
`tests/wire_contract.rs` to avoid a `serde_json` dev-dependency. That was the wrong
trade, and is reverted: 370 lines of hand-rolled serde plumbing exercises *serde*, not
our codec, and carries a maintenance cost forever for no return.

**Decision.** `proptest` is already a dev-dependency, so the project's position is
already settled: a dev-dependency is build-time tooling for `cargo test`, not a
consumer's supply chain, and `tests/manifest_contract.rs` correctly gates only
`[dependencies]`, a library consumer's non-optional dependency set stays empty either
way. The concession is bounded by an explicit allowlist rather than left open:
`[dev-dependencies]` names exactly `{proptest, serde_json}`, asserted by
`tests/manifest_contract.rs`, so a third entry requires an amendment here rather than a
quiet commit.

**Consequence.** `serde` and `serde_json` remain `optional = true` under
`[dependencies]`, and `cargo tree -e normal --no-default-features` still prints the crate
alone.
